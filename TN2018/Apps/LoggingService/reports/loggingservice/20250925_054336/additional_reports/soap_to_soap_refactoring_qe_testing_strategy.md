Not Applicable - No SOAP endpoints requiring refactoring were detected.

### Analysis Summary

A thorough review of the provided codebase for the `LoggingService` TIBCO BusinessWorks module was conducted. The analysis confirms that this module does not define, expose, or consume any SOAP services.

**Evidence:**
*   **Process Definition (`Processes/loggingservice/LogProcess.bwp`):** The core process is a callable sub-process, not a web service. It utilizes file (`bw.file`), XML (`bw.xml`), and general activities, but contains no SOAP or HTTP-related activities (e.g., `SOAPRequestReply`, `HTTPReceiver`).
*   **Manifest File (`META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`):** The module dependencies do not include required palettes for SOAP or HTTP services, such as `com.tibco.bw.palette.http` or `com.tibco.bw.palette.soap`.
*   **Service Descriptors:** The project contains only XSD schema definitions for data structures (`Schemas/`) and no WSDL files that would define a SOAP service contract.

**Conclusion:**
The `LoggingService` module is designed for internal logging operations (writing to console or files) and lacks any SOAP-based integration points. Therefore, a QE testing strategy for SOAP-to-SOAP security refactoring is not applicable to this codebase.
