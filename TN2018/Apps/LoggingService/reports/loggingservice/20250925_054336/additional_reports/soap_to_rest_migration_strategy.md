Not Applicable - No SOAP endpoints detected, no migration strategy required.

### Executive Summary

The analysis of the provided codebase for the `LoggingService` project reveals that it is a TIBCO BusinessWorks (BW) 6.5 module. However, there is no evidence of any SOAP services or endpoints being defined or implemented. The core component is a callable process (`Processes/loggingservice/LogProcess.bwp`) that functions as a logging utility, writing messages to the console or files based on its input. Since no SOAP services were found, a SOAP to REST migration strategy is not applicable.

### Evidence Summary

The conclusion that no SOAP services exist is based on the following evidence from the codebase:

*   **No WSDL Files**: The `Service Descriptors/` folder, which is the standard location for WSDL (Web Services Description Language) files in a TIBCO BW project, is empty.
*   **No SOAP Bindings**: The main process file, `Processes/loggingservice/LogProcess.bwp`, defines a callable process with input and output schemas but does not contain any SOAP service bindings, port types, or operations. It is initiated by a `tibex:receiveEvent`, which is a generic process starter, not a specific service binding.
*   **Missing Dependencies**: The `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file does not list dependencies on TIBCO BW palettes required for SOAP services (e.g., `bw.palette.soap`, `bw.palette.http`). The declared dependencies are for general activities, file operations, and XML processing.
*   **Project Purpose**: The schemas (`LogSchema.xsd`, `LogResult.xsd`) and process logic clearly indicate the module's purpose is to receive a log message and write it to a destination (console or file), not to expose a complex business service via SOAP.
