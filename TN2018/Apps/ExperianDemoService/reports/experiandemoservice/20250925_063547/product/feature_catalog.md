## Executive Summary

Based on the codebase, this application provides a single, focused business capability: retrieving an individual's credit score information from an internal database. The system functions as an internal microservice that accepts a person's details (name, date of birth, SSN) and returns their FICO score, a credit rating, and the number of recent inquiries. This enables other business systems to quickly assess creditworthiness without incurring the cost or latency of a live call to an external credit bureau.

## Analysis

### Feature Catalog

| Feature Name | Business Value | Who Benefits | What It Does | Business Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Internal Credit Score Lookup** | Enables rapid, low-cost creditworthiness assessment for business decisions like loan approvals or identity verification. | Risk Management, Underwriting, Sales, Customer Service | Provides a person's FICO score, credit rating, and number of recent inquiries by looking up their Social Security Number (SSN) in an internal company database. | Reduces operational costs by avoiding per-transaction fees to external credit bureaus. Accelerates business processes that depend on credit data, improving customer experience and decision-making speed. |
| **Automated Credit Data API** | Provides a standardized, automated way for other internal applications to access credit information, reducing manual processes and ensuring data consistency. | Internal Development Teams, Business Process Automation | Exposes a secure endpoint that accepts a person's details (First Name, Last Name, DOB, SSN) in a JSON format and returns their credit profile. | Enables seamless integration of credit checks into various business workflows (e.g., online applications, customer onboarding), improving operational efficiency and reducing data entry errors. |

## Evidence Summary

-   **Scope Analyzed**: The analysis covered the TIBCO BusinessWorks project `ExperianService.module`, including its process definitions, service descriptors, schemas, and resource configurations.
-   **Key Data Points**:
    -   **1 Core Feature Identified**: The system's sole function is to retrieve credit score data.
    -   **API Endpoint**: The service exposes a `POST /creditscore` endpoint for this purpose.
    -   **Input Data**: The service requires `firstName`, `lastName`, `dob`, and `ssn` for a lookup.
    -   **Output Data**: The service returns `fiCOScore`, `rating`, and `noOfInquiries`.
-   **References**:
    -   The business process is defined in `ExperianService.module/Processes/experianservice/module/Process.bwp`.
    -   The API contract and endpoint path (`/creditscore`) are defined in `ExperianService.module/Service Descriptors/experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json`.
    -   The input data requirements are defined by the schema in `ExperianService.module/Schemas/ExperianRequestSchema.xsd`.
    -   The core business logic involves a JDBC query (`SELECT * FROM public.creditscore where ssn like ?`) found within the `Process.bwp` file, indicating it retrieves data from an internal database rather than making a live external call.
    -   The output data structure is defined in `ExperianService.module/Schemas/ExperianResponseSchemaResource.xsd`.

## Assumptions Made

-   **Business Domain**: It is assumed this application serves the Financial Services or a related industry where credit assessment is a core business function.
-   **Data Source**: The service is named `ExperianService`, which implies a relationship with the Experian credit bureau. However, the code exclusively queries an internal PostgreSQL database table named `public.creditscore`. It is assumed this internal table is populated with data originating from Experian through a separate, out-of-scope process (e.g., a periodic batch data load).
-   **User Definition**: The "user" of this service is assumed to be another automated system or application, not a human end-user, as it functions as a backend API.

## Open Questions

-   What is the business process for populating and refreshing the data in the `public.creditscore` database table?
-   What are the specific business definitions for the `rating` and `noOfInquiries` fields returned by the service?
-   What are the service level agreements (SLAs) for this service regarding uptime and response time?
-   What security and compliance policies (e.g., data access logging, PII protection) govern the use of this sensitive credit data?

## Confidence Level

**Overall Confidence**: High

**Rationale**: The provided codebase represents a small, self-contained TIBCO BusinessWorks module with a single, clearly defined process. The evidence for the feature is unambiguous and directly traceable from the API endpoint definition through the data processing steps to the final response. The logic is straightforward, leaving little room for misinterpretation of its core business function.

**Evidence**:
-   **File references with line numbers where patterns were found**: The entire workflow is defined declaratively in `ExperianService.module/Processes/experianservice/module/Process.bwp`.
-   **Configuration files that informed decisions**: `ExperianService.module/Resources/experianservice/module/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` confirms the use of a PostgreSQL database, and `ExperianService.module/Service Descriptors/experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json` confirms the REST API contract.
-   **Code examples that demonstrate current implementation**: The JDBC Query activity within `Process.bwp` explicitly contains the SQL statement `SELECT * FROM public.creditscore where ssn like ?`, which is definitive evidence of the internal data lookup mechanism.

## Action Items

**Immediate**:
-   [ ] **Clarify Data Source**: Business stakeholders should confirm the origin and refresh frequency of the data in the `public.creditscore` table to understand the timeliness of the credit information being served.

**Short-term**:
-   [ ] **Document Business Rules**: The business owners for `rating` and `noOfInquiries` should provide clear definitions for these data points to ensure they are used correctly by consuming systems.

**Long-term**:
-   [ ] **Review Service Name**: Consider renaming the service to better reflect its function as an *internal* credit data provider (e.g., `InternalCreditScoreService`) to avoid confusion about it being a live proxy to Experian.

## Risk Assessment

-   **High Risk**: A failure in the process that populates the `public.creditscore` table would result in this service providing stale or no data, which could lead to incorrect business decisions (e.g., approving a bad loan).
-   **Medium Risk**: The service name `ExperianService` is misleading. New developers or analysts might incorrectly assume it makes live calls to Experian, leading to incorrect architectural or business process designs.
-   **Low Risk**: The direct use of `ssn like ?` in the SQL query could have performance implications if the `ssn` column is not properly indexed. This could degrade response times under high load.
