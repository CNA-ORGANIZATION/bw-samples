### Report Generation Notice
- **Analysis Scope**: This report is based on the files provided in the cache.
- **Persona**: The report is generated from the perspective of a **Business Requirements Analyst and Service Level Manager**.
- **Instructions**: The analysis follows the guidelines specified in `prompts/personas/product/non-functional-business-requirements.md` and `prompts/output-expectations.md`.

## Executive Summary
This analysis identifies the business-level service expectations for the Experian Credit Score service. The system's primary function is to provide credit scores based on sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII), making it a critical component in processes like loan origination or customer vetting. Key non-functional requirements derived from the code include a strict performance expectation of returning credit data in under 10 seconds. Significant business risks exist around the system's availability, its handling of sensitive data (SSN), and the current storage of database credentials, which could impact customer trust and regulatory compliance.

## Analysis
### Finding/Area 1: Service Performance Expectations
**Evidence**: The TIBCO BusinessWorks process `ExperianService.module\Processes\experianservice\module\Process.bwp` contains a JDBC Query activity with a configured `timeout="10"`. This activity is responsible for retrieving credit score data from the backend database.

**Impact**: This 10-second timeout defines a critical business service level. If the database fails to return a customer's credit information within this window, the entire process fails. For a customer applying for a loan or credit, a wait time approaching 10 seconds is at the upper limit of acceptable, and failure to respond within this window leads directly to a negative outcome for the user and a lost opportunity for the business.

**Recommendation**: The business should validate if a 10-second service level agreement (SLA) for credit score retrieval meets customer experience targets. A review should be conducted to determine if a faster response time is necessary to reduce application abandonment rates.

### Finding/Area 2: System Availability Dependencies
**Evidence**: The process file `Process.bwp` and resource files `Creditscore.httpConnResource` and `JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` show a direct, hard dependency on a PostgreSQL database (`jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/bookstore`). The service cannot function if this database is unavailable.

**Impact**: The credit scoring service is a single point of failure for any business workflow that relies on it. Downtime in the database or the TIBCO application directly translates to an inability to process credit applications, onboard new customers, or make lending decisions. This operational dependency means that the database's availability and recovery time objectives (RTO/RPO) are intrinsically linked to the business's ability to generate revenue.

**Recommendation**: A formal Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the availability of the credit scoring service should be established. This SLA must account for the availability of its dependent components, including the TIBCO environment and the PostgreSQL database.

### Finding/Area 3: Data Security and Compliance
**Evidence**: The service contract defined in `ExperianService.module\Service Descriptors\experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json` specifies that the service accepts highly sensitive PII, including `ssn`, `dob`, `firstName`, and `lastName`. The database connection resource `JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` contains an encrypted password (`#!+ZBCsMf2u4acq8mLX/mPA52dceRkuczQ`) directly in the configuration file.

**Impact**: The system processes data that is heavily regulated under standards like the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). Storing credentials, even if encrypted, within application configuration files poses a significant security risk. A breach could lead to massive regulatory fines, legal liability, and irreparable damage to the company's reputation.

**Recommendation**: The business must enforce a strict policy for managing secrets. Database credentials should be migrated from configuration files to a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., a secure vault) to minimize the risk of unauthorized access and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

### Business Service Level Table

| Business Process | Customer Expectation | Current Capability | Business Impact if Not Met | Monthly Value at Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Credit Score Retrieval** | A near-instant decision on credit applications. | The system is hard-coded to fail any request that takes longer than **10 seconds** to retrieve data from the database. | High cart/application abandonment rates, lost sales opportunities, poor customer satisfaction. | The total value of all business transactions (e.g., loans, new accounts) that are dependent on this credit check. |

### Critical Business Service Levels

#### Customer Experience Requirements
- **Responsiveness**: Customers applying for credit expect a decision almost immediately. The system's current 10-second timeout for data retrieval sets a firm upper boundary on this experience. Exceeding this time results in a failed transaction, frustrating the customer and potentially causing them to seek a competitor.
- **Reliability**: The service must be consistently available. If a customer's application fails due to system unavailability, they are unlikely to return, representing a permanent loss of that business opportunity.

#### Operational Efficiency Requirements
- **Process Automation**: This service automates a critical decision-making checkpoint. If it is unavailable, business processes like loan approvals would need to revert to slow, costly manual credit checks, severely impacting operational efficiency and scalability.
- **Batch Processing**: The configured 10-second timeout must be met even during peak processing times or when batch jobs are running, as failure to do so would halt real-time customer interactions.

### Business Availability Requirements

| Business Hours | Critical Processes | Acceptable Downtime | Business Impact per Hour Down |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **24/7** (Assumed for online applications) | Credit Score Retrieval | **Extremely Low** (e.g., < 5 minutes/month) | Complete halt of all new customer credit-based transactions, leading to direct revenue loss and reputational damage. |

### Performance Impact on Business

| User Action | Expected Experience | Business Benefit | If Too Slow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Submit a credit application** | Receive a decision in **under 10 seconds**. | High conversion rates, increased customer acquisition, competitive advantage. | A significant percentage of users will abandon the application, leading to direct revenue loss and brand erosion. |

### Security & Compliance Business Requirements

| Compliance Need | Business Reason | If Not Met | Annual Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Protection of PII (SSN, DOB)** | To comply with financial regulations (e.g., FCRA, GLBA) and maintain customer trust. | Severe regulatory fines, class-action lawsuits, loss of business licenses, and catastrophic brand damage. | Potentially millions in fines and lost business value. |
| **Secure Credential Management** | To prevent unauthorized access to the sensitive credit score database. | A data breach could expose the entire customer credit database, leading to the consequences listed above. | High. A single breach could have an existential impact on the business. |

## Evidence Summary
- **Scope Analyzed**: The analysis covered all files within the `ExperianService` and `ExperianService.module` projects, focusing on TIBCO process definitions (`.bwp`), resource configurations (`.httpConnResource`, `.jdbcResource`), and service descriptors (`.json`, `.xsd`).
- **Key Data Points**:
  - JDBC Query Timeout: **10 seconds**
  - HTTP Receiver Timeout: **60 seconds**
  - Database Dependency: **PostgreSQL**
  - Sensitive Data Processed: **SSN, DOB, Name**
- **References**: Evidence was primarily extracted from `ExperianService.module/Processes/experianservice/module/Process.bwp` and `ExperianService.module/Resources/experianservice/module/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource`.

## Assumptions Made
- The `ExperianService` is a business-critical function used for real-time customer-facing processes, such as loan applications or identity verification.
- The business operates in a jurisdiction with strict data privacy and financial regulations (e.g., United States or Europe).
- The database name `bookstore` is a placeholder, and the actual database contains sensitive credit information as implied by the service's function.
- The service is expected to be highly available (24/7) to support online, self-service customer applications.

## Open Questions
- What is the formal business Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the response time of the credit score service? Does the 10-second technical limit align with business expectations?
- What are the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for the underlying PostgreSQL database?
- What is the business impact of a single credit check transaction failing?
- Is there a defined business continuity plan if the Experian service or its dependent database becomes unavailable?
- What is the company's official policy on storing credentials in configuration files versus a centralized secrets management system?

## Confidence Level
**Overall Confidence**: High

**Rationale**: The TIBCO process file (`Process.bwp`) provides a clear, declarative definition of the service workflow, including explicit timeout configurations. The resource and schema files definitively identify the technology stack, data dependencies, and the nature of the data being processed. The business purpose is unambiguous based on the service name and the data contract.

**Evidence**:
- **File**: `ExperianService.module\Processes\experianservice\module\Process.bwp` - Clearly defines the 10-second JDBC timeout.
- **File**: `ExperianService.module\Service Descriptors\experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json` - Explicitly lists `ssn` and `dob` as required input, confirming the sensitive nature of the service.
- **File**: `ExperianService.module\Resources\experianservice\module\JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` - Shows the database type and the presence of a stored password.

## Action Items
**Immediate** (This Sprint):
- [ ] **Risk Assessment Workshop**: Convene a meeting with business, security, and legal stakeholders to review the risks associated with handling PII and the current credential management strategy.
- [ ] **Create Security Backlog Item**: Create a high-priority story to migrate database credentials from the configuration file to a secure vault.

**Short-term** (Next 1-2 Sprints):
- [ ] **Validate Performance SLA**: Work with the product owner to formally define and document the business SLA for credit score response time, confirming if the 10-second timeout is appropriate.
- [ ] **Implement Credential Migration**: Execute the plan to move database credentials to a secure secrets management system.

**Long-term** (Next Quarter):
- [ ] **Review High-Availability Architecture**: Initiate an architectural review to assess and improve the high-availability and disaster recovery posture of the service and its dependent database.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**:
  - **Data Breach**: A compromise of the application's configuration files could expose database credentials, leading to a massive breach of sensitive customer credit data.
  - **Regulatory Non-Compliance**: Improper handling of PII or a data breach could result in severe fines and legal penalties.
- **Medium Risk**:
  - **Service Unavailability**: The lack of apparent redundancy for the database or TIBCO application creates a risk of prolonged outages, directly halting revenue-generating activities.
  - **Poor Customer Experience**: Response times approaching the 10-second limit may lead to high application abandonment rates.
- **Low Risk**:
  - The 60-second HTTP receiver timeout is overly permissive but unlikely to be hit in normal operation. It represents a minor configuration issue rather than an immediate threat.
