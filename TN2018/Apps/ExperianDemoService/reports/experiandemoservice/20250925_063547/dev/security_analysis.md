## Executive Summary

This security analysis of the `ExperianService` TIBCO application reveals critical security vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. The service, which processes sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like Social Security Numbers (SSN), currently operates without any authentication and transmits data over unencrypted HTTP. While the application effectively prevents SQL Injection by using prepared statements, the lack of fundamental transport-layer security and access control exposes the service and its data to significant risk of unauthorized access and data interception.

## Analysis

### Finding/Area 1: Critical - No Authentication on a Sensitive Data Endpoint

**Evidence**:
- The primary business function is exposed via a REST endpoint defined in `ExperianService.module\Service Descriptors\experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json`.
- The Swagger 2.0 definition for the `/creditscore` endpoint lacks any `securityDefinitions` or `security` sections, indicating it is a public, unauthenticated endpoint.
- The TIBCO process definition (`ExperianService.module\Processes\experianservice\module\Process.bwp`) for the `HTTPReceiver` activity shows no configuration for authentication policies.

**Impact**:
- Any party with network access to the service can query for credit score information using just an SSN, first name, last name, and date of birth.
- This represents a severe data breach risk, allowing for mass harvesting of sensitive financial and personal data.
- The system is vulnerable to unauthorized access and abuse, potentially leading to significant regulatory fines (e.g., under GDPR, CCPA), financial liability, and severe reputational damage.

**Recommendation**:
- **Immediate**: Implement mandatory API Key-based authentication for the `/creditscore` endpoint. This provides a baseline level of access control.
- **Short-term**: Migrate to a more robust authentication mechanism like OAuth 2.0 (Client Credentials Grant) to provide stronger, token-based security suitable for service-to-service communication.

### Finding/Area 2: Critical - Unencrypted Data Transmission (No HTTPS/TLS)

**Evidence**:
- The HTTP connection resource is defined in `ExperianService.module\Resources\experianservice\module\Creditscore.httpConnResource.xml` to use port `7080`.
- The service descriptor (`experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json`) explicitly lists `"http"` as the only scheme, confirming the absence of HTTPS.
- The request schema (`ExperianRequestSchema.xsd`) includes highly sensitive fields: `ssn`, `dob`, `firstName`, and `lastName`.

**Impact**:
- All data, including SSNs, sent to and from the service is transmitted in plaintext.
- This data is vulnerable to interception (e.g., Man-in-the-Middle attacks), allowing attackers to steal sensitive user information directly from network traffic.
- This is a direct violation of data protection best practices and likely fails to meet compliance standards like PCI-DSS (if payment data were involved) and general data privacy regulations.

**Recommendation**:
- **Immediate**: Reconfigure the TIBCO HTTP Connector shared resource to enforce TLS 1.2 or higher. Update all clients to use the `https` protocol.
- **Short-term**: Implement a certificate management strategy for renewing and deploying TLS certificates to prevent service interruptions.

### Finding/Area 3: High - Potential PII Exposure in Logs and Error Messages

**Evidence**:
- The TIBCO process (`Process.bwp`) includes a generic error handling path but does not specify any data masking or sanitization logic before potential logging or in error responses.
- The process directly uses the input `ssn` from the `ParseJSON` step in the `JDBCQuery` step. It is common for middleware platforms to log activity inputs/outputs for debugging, which would include the plaintext SSN.
- Error responses are not explicitly defined, creating a risk that detailed exceptions (including data) could be sent back to the client.

**Impact**:
- Logging of plaintext SSNs creates a secondary data exposure risk. If log files are compromised, a large volume of sensitive data could be stolen.
- Verbose error messages returned to a client could leak internal system details or sensitive data, aiding an attacker in further exploiting the system.

**Recommendation**:
- **High Priority**: Implement a logging policy that explicitly masks sensitive fields like `ssn` and `dob` before writing to logs. Replace sensitive data with asterisks or a hashed value.
- **Medium Priority**: Standardize error responses. Ensure that client-facing errors are generic and do not contain stack traces, internal data, or sensitive information. Log detailed errors internally for debugging.

### Finding/Area 4: Strength - Good Security Practices Found

**Evidence**:
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: The `JDBCQuery` activity in `Process.bwp` is configured to use a prepared statement (`sqlStatement="SELECT * FROM public.creditscore where ssn like ?"`). This is the correct and effective way to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **Encrypted Credentials**: The JDBC connection resource (`JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource`) stores the database password in an encrypted format (`password="#!+ZBCsMf2u4acq8mLX/mPA52dceRkuczQ"`).

**Impact**:
- The application is protected against one of the most common and damaging web application vulnerabilities (SQLi).
- Storing the database password encrypted in the configuration file reduces the risk of credential theft if the file is accidentally exposed.

**Recommendation**:
- **Maintain**: Continue the practice of using prepared statements for all database queries.
- **Enhance**: As a long-term improvement, migrate the database credentials from the configuration file into a dedicated secrets management service like GCP Secret Manager or HashiCorp Vault to centralize and further secure them.

## Evidence Summary

- **Scope Analyzed**: The analysis covered the entire `ExperianService` TIBCO project, including process definitions, service descriptors, schemas, and resource configurations.
- **Key Data Points**:
    - 1 REST endpoint (`/creditscore`) analyzed.
    - 0 authentication mechanisms found.
    - 100% of data is transmitted over unencrypted HTTP.
    - 1 prepared statement identified, mitigating SQLi risk.
- **References**: Analysis is based on `Process.bwp`, `experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json`, `Creditscore.httpConnResource`, and `JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource`.

## Assumptions Made

- It is assumed that there is no external security layer (e.g., an API Gateway like Apigee) in front of this TIBCO service that is enforcing authentication and TLS termination. The analysis is based solely on the code provided.
- It is assumed that the business purpose of this service is to retrieve credit score information based on PII, making the data handled highly sensitive.
- It is assumed that standard TIBCO logging practices, without custom masking, would log the inputs to activities, thus exposing the SSN.

## Open Questions

- Is there an API Gateway or load balancer in front of this service that handles TLS termination and authentication? If so, the risks related to unencrypted transport and lack of authentication may be mitigated at that layer.
- What are the specific data logging and retention policies for this application? Are full request payloads being logged?
- What are the compliance requirements for this application (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, etc.)?

## Confidence Level

**Overall Confidence**: High

**Rationale**: The evidence for the critical vulnerabilities is clear and unambiguous. The lack of security configurations in the TIBCO process definition and service descriptors is definitive proof. The use of `http` and a non-standard port (`7080`) strongly indicates no TLS is in use at the application layer. The use of a prepared statement is also clearly defined in the `JDBCQuery` configuration.

**Evidence**:
- **No Authentication**: `ExperianService.module\Service Descriptors\experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json` lacks a `securityDefinitions` block.
- **No Encryption**: `ExperianService.module\Resources\experianservice\module\Creditscore.httpConnResource.xml` defines `port="7080"` with no mention of SSL/TLS configuration.
- **SQLi Prevention**: `ExperianService.module\Processes\experianservice\module\Process.bwp` shows the JDBC Query activity using a parameterized query (`ssn like ?`).

## Action Items

**Immediate (Next 1-2 Sprints)**:
- [ ] **Enforce HTTPS**: Configure the HTTP Connector to use TLS and disable the plaintext HTTP port `7080`.
- [ ] **Implement API Key Auth**: Add API Key validation to the `/creditscore` endpoint as an interim security measure.
- [ ] **Mask PII in Logs**: Implement a logging interceptor or modify logging configurations to mask the `ssn` and `dob` fields.

**Short-term (Next Quarter)**:
- [ ] **Migrate to OAuth 2.0**: Replace the API Key mechanism with a more secure OAuth 2.0 flow.
- [ ] **Standardize Error Handling**: Implement a global exception handler that returns generic error messages to clients while logging detailed information internally.
- [ ] **Add Input Validation**: Add schema-level validation for the format of the `ssn` and `dob` fields.

**Long-term (Next 6 Months)**:
- [ ] **Centralize Secrets**: Migrate database credentials from the `.jdbcResource` file to a secure secret management system (e.g., GCP Secret Manager).
- [ ] **Automated Security Scanning**: Integrate SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tools into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**:
    - **Unauthorized Access**: The lack of authentication on an endpoint that queries data by SSN is a critical risk.
    - **Data Interception**: Transmitting SSNs and other PII over unencrypted HTTP makes the application highly vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Medium Risk**:
    - **Information Disclosure**: Unhandled exceptions could leak internal system details or sensitive data in error messages.
    - **PII in Logs**: If logs are not properly secured, the presence of SSNs creates a significant data exposure risk.
- **Low Risk**:
    - **Insecure Credential Storage**: While the password is encrypted, storing credentials in a config file is less secure than using a dedicated secrets manager.
