## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the integration dependencies for the `ExperianService` application. The system is a TIBCO BusinessWorks (BW) application that functions as a single, synchronous REST API microservice. Its core purpose is to receive a user's personal information (specifically an SSN) via an HTTP POST request, query a PostgreSQL database to retrieve credit score data, and return this information in a JSON format.

The application's architecture is a simple point-to-point, request-response pattern. It has two primary integration points: an inbound REST API endpoint and an outbound JDBC connection to a PostgreSQL database. The PostgreSQL database is a critical, high-risk dependency, as the service is entirely dependent on it to function. The current implementation lacks any form of authentication, posing a significant security risk.

## Integration Architecture Overview

*   **Integration Style**: The system employs a **Point-to-Point**, synchronous, request-response integration style. It acts as a classic REST service that directly queries a backend database to fulfill requests.
*   **Coupling Levels**: The internal TIBCO process components are tightly coupled within a single execution flow. Externally, the service is tightly coupled to its PostgreSQL database, as any database failure or latency will directly impact the service's availability and performance.
*   **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous**: All integrations are **synchronous**. The service blocks and waits for a database response before sending a reply to the calling client.
*   **Dependency Criticality**: The PostgreSQL database is a **Critical** dependency. The service cannot perform its function without a successful connection and query to this database.

### External System Dependencies

| System Name | Type | Integration Pattern | Criticality | Configuration Evidence | Risk Factors |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PostgreSQL Database** | Database | JDBC Query (Request-Response) | **Critical** | `ExperianService.module/Resources/experianservice/module/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` | **Single Point of Failure**: Service is non-functional if the database is unavailable.<br>**Performance**: Service latency is directly tied to database query performance.<br>**Security**: Credentials are obfuscated but stored in configuration, posing a risk if not managed securely. |
| **API Consumer** | API (Inbound) | REST/HTTP (Request-Response) | **Critical** | `ExperianService.module/Service Descriptors/experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json`<br>`ExperianService.module/Resources/experianservice/module/Creditscore.httpConnResource` | **Security**: The endpoint is unauthenticated, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data retrieval functions.<br>**Network Dependency**: Relies on network availability for clients to connect.<br>**Contract Changes**: Any change to the API contract can break client applications. |

### Internal Component Dependencies

*   **Component Coupling Analysis**: The application is a single TIBCO BusinessWorks module, which can be considered a modular monolith. Within this module, the process flow consists of several activities (`HTTPReceiver`, `ParseJSON`, `JDBCQuery`, `RenderJSON`, `SendHTTPResponse`) that are **tightly coupled** in a sequential chain. Data is passed directly from one activity to the next within the process instance. There are no dependencies on other internal microservices or shared libraries outside of the standard TIBCO palettes.
*   **Communication Patterns**: All internal communication is **synchronous**, occurring as direct data mapping within the TIBCO process flow defined in `ExperianService.module/Processes/experianservice/module/Process.bwp`.

### Data Flow Dependencies

*   **Data Sources**:
    *   An inbound HTTP POST request to the `/creditscore` endpoint, containing a JSON body with user PII (`ssn`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `dob`).
*   **Data Transformations**:
    1.  The incoming JSON string is parsed into an XML structure based on the schema in `ExperianService.module/Schemas/ExperianRequestSchema.xsd`.
    2.  The `ssn` field is extracted from the parsed data.
    3.  This `ssn` is used as a parameter in a SQL query against the `public.creditscore` table.
    4.  The result set from the database is mapped to an XML structure based on `ExperianService.module/Schemas/ExperianResponseSchemaResource.xsd`.
    5.  This XML structure is rendered into the final JSON response string.
*   **Data Destinations**:
    *   An outbound HTTP response containing a JSON body with credit information (`fiCOScore`, `rating`, `noOfInquiries`).
    *   The PostgreSQL database is only read from; no data is written or updated.

### Integration Risk Assessment

*   **High-Risk Dependencies**:
    *   **PostgreSQL Database**: This is a single point of failure. Any downtime, performance degradation, or connectivity issue with the database will cause the entire service to fail.
    *   **Unsecured API Endpoint**: The `/creditscore` endpoint lacks any authentication or authorization, presenting a critical security vulnerability. It allows any party with network access to query for sensitive credit information, which could lead to a data breach.
*   **Medium-Risk Dependencies**:
    *   **Credential Management**: The database password, while obfuscated, is stored in the `JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` file. This is a security risk if the file is not properly secured and credentials are not rotated or managed via a secrets vault.
*   **Low-Risk Dependencies**:
    *   There are no low-risk dependencies identified, as the service's two external integration points are both critical to its function and security.

### Decoupling Recommendations

*   **Immediate Opportunities**:
    *   **Implement Circuit Breakers**: Wrap the `JDBCQuery` activity in a circuit breaker pattern. This would allow the service to fail fast and return a cached or default response if the database is down, preventing cascading failures.
    *   **Introduce an API Gateway**: Place an API Gateway (e.g., Apigee) in front of the TIBCO service. This decouples security and rate limiting from the business logic, allowing for the immediate implementation of API Key or OAuth2 authentication without modifying the core TIBCO process.
*   **Strategic Improvements**:
    *   **Event-Driven Architecture**: For scenarios where a real-time response is not strictly necessary, the process could be re-architected to be asynchronous. The HTTP request could publish an event to a message queue (e.g., Kafka), and a separate consumer process would handle the database query and notify the client via a webhook or another mechanism. This would decouple the service from the database's real-time availability.

## Evidence Summary

*   **Scope Analyzed**: The analysis covered the entire `ExperianService` TIBCO project, including the application module and parent application wrapper.
*   **Key Data Points**:
    *   **1** TIBCO BusinessWorks Process (`Process.bwp`)
    *   **1** Inbound REST/HTTP Endpoint (`/creditscore`)
    *   **1** Outbound Database Connection (PostgreSQL)
    *   **0** Authenticated endpoints
*   **References**:
    *   `ExperianService.module/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`: Identified JDBC, REST/JSON, and HTTP palette dependencies.
    *   `ExperianService.module/Resources/experianservice/module/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource`: Confirmed PostgreSQL as the database and identified connection credentials.
    *   `ExperianService.module/Processes/experianservice/module/Process.bwp`: Analyzed the end-to-end synchronous data flow from HTTP request to JDBC query to HTTP response.
    *   `ExperianService.module/Service Descriptors/experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json`: Confirmed the REST API contract (path, method, request/response schemas).

## Assumptions Made

*   **Environment Configuration**: It is assumed that the `localhost` value for the database and HTTP host is for development purposes and would be replaced by environment-specific variables in TEST and PROD environments.
*   **Database Schema**: It is assumed that the `public.creditscore` table exists in the target PostgreSQL database and contains the columns being queried (`firstname`, `lastname`, `ssn`, `ficoscore`, etc.).
*   **Client Existence**: It is assumed there are one or more client applications that depend on this service's contract as defined in the Swagger file.

## Open Questions

*   What are the authentication and authorization requirements for this service?
*   What are the non-functional requirements, such as expected transactions per second (TPS), latency, and availability (SLAs/SLOs)?
*   How is configuration (e.g., database URLs, credentials) managed across different environments (Dev, Test, Prod)?
*   What is the business impact if this service is unavailable?

## Confidence Level

**Overall Confidence**: **High**

**Rationale**: The provided codebase represents a small, self-contained TIBCO BusinessWorks application. The dependencies are explicit and clearly defined in the project's configuration and process files. The data flow is linear and easy to trace, leaving little room for ambiguity regarding the primary integration points.

**Evidence**:
*   The JDBC connection is explicitly defined in `ExperianService.module/Resources/experianservice/module/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource`.
*   The HTTP listener is explicitly defined in `ExperianService.module/Resources/experianservice/module/Creditscore.httpConnResource`.
*   The exact SQL query is visible within the `JDBCQuery` activity in `ExperianService.module/Processes/experianservice/module/Process.bwp`.
*   The API contract is fully documented in `ExperianService.module/Service Descriptors/experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json`.

## Action Items

**Immediate**
*   **[ ] Secure the Endpoint**: Implement API Key or OAuth2-based authentication, preferably via an API Gateway, to mitigate the critical security risk of the unauthenticated endpoint.
*   **[ ] Externalize Credentials**: Migrate the database credentials from the configuration file to a secure secrets management system (e.g., GCP Secret Manager, HashiCorp Vault) to prevent credential exposure.

**Short-term**
*   **[ ] Implement Monitoring**: Add monitoring for the database connection health and query latency to proactively detect performance issues or outages.
*   **[ ] Implement Circuit Breaker**: Add a circuit breaker to the database call to improve the service's resilience during database unavailability.

**Long-term**
*   **[ ] Evaluate Asynchronous Pattern**: Assess if the business process can be converted to an asynchronous, event-driven pattern to fully decouple the service from the database's real-time availability.

## Risk Assessment

*   **High Risk**:
    *   **Security Vulnerability**: The lack of authentication on an endpoint that processes PII (SSN) is a critical risk that could lead to a data breach.
    *   **Service Availability**: The tight coupling with the PostgreSQL database makes the service highly susceptible to database outages, directly impacting any dependent business processes.
*   **Medium Risk**:
    *   **Credential Exposure**: Storing credentials within the project's resource files, even if obfuscated, is a security risk.
*   **Low Risk**:
    *   **Performance Bottleneck**: While not evident without load testing, the synchronous database query could become a performance bottleneck under high load.
