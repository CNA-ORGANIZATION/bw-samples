## Executive Summary

This report provides a technical architecture analysis of the `ExperianService` application. The system is a monolithic integration service built using TIBCO BusinessWorks (BW) 6.5. Its core function is to expose a single RESTful API endpoint (`/creditscore`) that accepts a user's Social Security Number (SSN) in a JSON payload, queries a PostgreSQL database for the corresponding credit score information, and returns the result as a JSON object. The architecture is a simple, linear request-response pattern with a clear separation of concerns between receiving data, processing it, and responding. Key risks identified include a lack of explicit error handling and the absence of any security mechanisms on the public-facing API.

## Analysis

### Architecture Overview

**Architectural Style**: **Monolithic Integration Service**
The application is a single, self-contained TIBCO BusinessWorks module that performs a specific integration task. It follows a classic **Layered Architecture** pattern within the process flow:
1.  **Presentation/API Layer**: An `HTTPReceiver` activity exposes a REST endpoint.
2.  **Logic Layer**: `ParseJSON` and `RenderJSON` activities handle data transformation.
3.  **Data Access Layer**: A `JDBCQuery` activity interacts with the database.
The communication pattern is synchronous **Request-Response**.

*   **Evidence**: The entire workflow is contained within a single process file (`ExperianService.module/Processes/experianservice/module/Process.bwp`). The activities are sequenced linearly: HTTP In -> Parse -> Query -> Render -> HTTP Out.

**Technology Stack**:
*   **Integration Platform**: TIBCO BusinessWorks (BW) 6.5.0
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL
*   **API Protocol**: REST/JSON over HTTP
*   **Languages/Formats**: TIBCO BW Process (XML-based), SQL, JSON, XSD

*   **Evidence**:
    *   `ExperianService.module/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` specifies `TIBCO-BW-Version: 6.5.0` and required palettes `bw.jdbc`, `bw.restjson`, `bw.http`.
    *   `ExperianService.module/Resources/experianservice/module/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` configures the `org.postgresql.Driver` and a JDBC URL `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/bookstore`.
    *   `ExperianService.module/Service Descriptors/experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json` defines the Swagger 2.0 contract for the REST API.

**Design Principles**:
The process demonstrates a basic adherence to the **Single Responsibility Principle** at the activity level, where each component in the flow has one specific job (e.g., parse, query, render). It uses a form of **Dependency Inversion** through TIBCO's shared resource configuration, where the process depends on abstractions (`jdbcProperty`, `httpConnectorResource`) that are configured externally.

*   **Evidence**: The `Process.bwp` file shows distinct activities for parsing, querying, and rendering. The process variables `jdbcProperty` and `httpConnectorResource` link to external shared resource files.

### Component Architecture Analysis

**Component Name**: `Process.bwp` (Main Process)

**Responsibilities**:
*   Exposes a RESTful API endpoint at `/creditscore` to receive credit score requests.
*   Parses the incoming JSON request to extract the user's SSN.
*   Queries a PostgreSQL database table named `creditscore` using the provided SSN.
*   Transforms the database query result into a structured JSON response.
*   Returns the JSON response to the original caller.

*   **Evidence**: The sequence of activities within `ExperianService.module/Processes/experianservice/module/Process.bwp`: `HTTPReceiver` -> `ParseJSON` -> `JDBCQuery` -> `RenderJSON` -> `SendHTTPResponse`.

**Dependencies**:
*   **Internal**: None. It is a single-process module.
*   **External**:
    *   **HTTP Connector**: `experianservice.module.Creditscore.httpConnResource` to listen for HTTP requests on port 7080.
    *   **JDBC Connection**: `experianservice.module.JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
    *   **Schemas**: `ExperianRequestSchema.xsd` and `ExperianResponseSchemaResource.xsd` for data contracts.

*   **Evidence**: The `<bpws:variables>` section in `Process.bwp` declares `httpConnectorResource` and `jdbcProperty` which point to the respective resource files.

**Interfaces**:
*   **Provided API**: A single REST endpoint `POST /creditscore`.
    *   **Request**: A JSON object containing `dob`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `ssn`.
    *   **Response**: A JSON object containing `fiCOScore`, `rating`, and `noOfInquiries`.

*   **Evidence**: The Swagger definition in `ExperianService.module/Service Descriptors/experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json` details the API contract.

**Implementation Quality**:
The implementation is simple and follows a clear, linear path, making it easy to understand. However, its quality is low due to a complete lack of explicit error handling. There are no fault handlers for potential JDBC errors (e.g., connection failure, no records found) or JSON parsing failures. The implementation is not resilient.

*   **Evidence**: The process diagram in `Process.bwp` shows only a "happy path" flow with no branches or exception-handling logic.

### Data Architecture Analysis

**Data Storage Strategy**:
*   The system uses a **PostgreSQL** database named `bookstore` as its data store.
*   The connection is configured to a local instance (`localhost:5432`).
*   The connection uses the username `bwuser` with an encrypted password.

*   **Evidence**: `ExperianService.module/Resources/experianservice/module/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` contains the JDBC driver, URL, and credentials.

**Data Flow Patterns**:
1.  An inbound JSON payload is received via HTTP POST.
2.  The JSON string is parsed into an XML structure within the TIBCO process based on `ExperianRequestSchema.xsd`.
3.  The `ssn` field is extracted and used as a parameter in a SQL query.
4.  The `JDBCQuery` activity returns a result set.
5.  The result set is mapped to another XML structure based on `ExperianResponseSchemaResource.xsd`.
6.  This final XML structure is rendered into a JSON string and sent as the HTTP response.

*   **Evidence**: The input and output bindings for the activities in `Process.bwp` show this data transformation flow.

**Data Access Patterns**:
*   Data access is performed via a single `JDBCQuery` activity.
*   The SQL query `SELECT * FROM public.creditscore where ssn like ?` is hardcoded directly within the activity's configuration. This use of `like` with a prepared statement parameter is unusual and may indicate a misunderstanding of how to use wildcards, or it may be intentional.

*   **Evidence**: The `<tibex:config>` section for the `JDBCQuery` activity in `Process.bwp` contains the hardcoded SQL statement.

### Communication Architecture

**Internal Communication**:
*   Communication between activities within the `Process.bwp` is handled by passing data through process variables (e.g., `ParseJSON`, `JDBCQuery`). This is a standard in-memory data flow within a TIBCO process.

*   **Evidence**: The `<bpws:variables>` section of `Process.bwp` defines the variables used to hold data between steps.

**External Communication**:
*   **Northbound (Inbound)**: The system exposes a REST/JSON API over HTTP, defined by the `HTTPReceiver` activity and the associated `Creditscore.httpConnResource`.
*   **Southbound (Outbound)**: The system communicates with a PostgreSQL database via a JDBC connection.

*   **Evidence**: `Creditscore.httpConnResource` defines the inbound HTTP listener. `JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` defines the outbound database connection.

**API Design**:
*   The API design is contract-first, defined by a Swagger 2.0 specification.
*   It uses a single `POST` method for a query operation, which is unconventional for a read-only action (a `GET` with a query parameter would be more idiomatic for REST).
*   The request and response schemas are clearly defined in external XSD files, promoting reusability and clear contracts.

*   **Evidence**: `Service Descriptors/experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json` is the Swagger contract. `Schemas/ExperianRequestSchema.xsd` and `Schemas/ExperianResponseSchemaResource.xsd` define the data structures.

## Evidence Summary

*   **Scope Analyzed**: The analysis covered the entire `ExperianService` TIBCO application, including the module, process files, resource configurations, and service descriptors.
*   **Key Data Points**:
    *   1 TIBCO Application (`ExperianService`)
    *   1 TIBCO Module (`ExperianService.module`)
    *   1 Business Process (`Process.bwp`)
    *   1 REST API endpoint (`POST /creditscore`)
    *   1 Database integration (PostgreSQL)
*   **References**: The analysis is based on key files such as `Process.bwp`, `MANIFEST.MF`, `*.jdbcResource`, `*.httpConnResource`, and `*.json` (Swagger).

## Assumptions Made

*   **Environment Configuration**: It is assumed that `localhost` in the database connection is a placeholder for development and that production deployments use substitution variables for environment-specific configurations.
*   **Database Schema**: It is assumed that the `public.creditscore` table exists in the `bookstore` PostgreSQL database with the columns expected by the `JDBCQuery` activity (`firstname`, `lastname`, `ssn`, etc.).
*   **Deployment**: It is assumed the application is deployed to a TIBCO BusinessWorks AppNode environment capable of running BW 6.5 applications.

## Open Questions

*   **Error Handling Strategy**: How are errors (e.g., database unavailable, SSN not found, invalid input JSON) handled? The process shows no explicit fault handling, which is a major architectural gap.
*   **Security**: How is the `/creditscore` endpoint secured? There is no evidence of authentication, authorization, or transport-level security (HTTPS).
*   **Configuration Management**: How are configurations for different environments (DEV, TEST, PROD) managed? The `default.substvar` files contain no environment-specific values.
*   **Performance & Scalability**: What are the non-functional requirements for this service regarding response time, throughput, and concurrent users?

## Confidence Level

**Overall Confidence**: **High**

**Rationale**: The project is small, self-contained, and uses standard TIBCO BW components in a straightforward manner. The architectural pattern is simple and well-defined by the process flow and resource configurations. The presence of a Swagger file provides a clear, definitive contract for the service's interface.

**Evidence**:
*   **File references**: The logic is almost entirely contained in `ExperianService.module/Processes/experianservice/module/Process.bwp`.
*   **Configuration files**: `JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` and `Creditscore.httpConnResource` clearly define the external integration points.
*   **Code examples**: The Swagger file `experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json` provides a complete definition of the API.

## Action Items

**Immediate**:
*   **[ ] Implement Error Handling**: Add fault handlers to the `Process.bwp` to gracefully manage scenarios like database connection errors, invalid input, and "SSN not found". Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400, 404, 500).

**Short-term**:
*   **[ ] Secure the API Endpoint**: Implement an authentication and authorization mechanism (e.g., API Key validation, OAuth 2.0) for the `/creditscore` endpoint. Enforce HTTPS.
*   **[ ] Externalize Configuration**: Move all environment-specific values (database host, port, credentials) from shared resources into substitution variable (`.substvar`) files for each target environment.

**Long-term**:
*   **[ ] Refactor API Design**: Consider changing the `POST /creditscore` endpoint to a `GET /creditscore?ssn={ssn}` to better align with RESTful principles for read operations, assuming security constraints can be met.
*   **[ ] Implement Logging**: Add logging at key stages of the process (request received, query executed, response sent) for improved observability and troubleshooting.

## Risk Assessment

*   **High Risk**:
    *   **No Security**: The API is completely open, allowing unauthorized access to potentially sensitive credit score data.
    *   **No Error Handling**: Any failure in the database connection or data parsing will likely result in an unhandled exception and a generic HTTP 500 error, providing a poor consumer experience and no diagnostic information.
*   **Medium Risk**:
    *   **Hardcoded Configuration**: Database connection details are hardcoded, making deployment across different environments manual and error-prone.
    *   **Hardcoded SQL**: The SQL query is embedded in the process, making it difficult to manage and update without redeploying the application.
*   **Low Risk**:
    *   **Unconventional API Design**: Using POST for a query operation is not standard but is functionally acceptable. It does not pose an immediate operational risk.
