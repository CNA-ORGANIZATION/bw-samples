An MFDA Test Case Designer would not generate a report with this file, as it does not contain any mainframe integration components. The `output-expectations.md` file requires that all analysis be evidence-based, and the `mfda_test_case_generator.md` file requires that the analysis focus exclusively on MFDA integration types (MFT, Apigee, Kafka, AlloyDB, Oracle).

The provided codebase is for a TIBCO BusinessWorks (BW) application. The analysis of the `ExperianService.module` reveals the following:
- **Integration Type**: It is a REST/JSON API that uses a JDBC connection.
- **API Endpoint**: It exposes a `/creditscore` endpoint via HTTP.
- **Database**: It connects to a PostgreSQL database (`jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/bookstore`), which is not a mainframe system.
- **Dependencies**: The `MANIFEST.MF` file shows dependencies on `bw.jdbc`, `bw.restjson`, and `bw.http`, confirming it is a standard web service with a database backend.

There is no evidence of MFT, mainframe-specific APIs, Kafka, or Oracle mainframe integrations. Therefore, the conditions for generating an MFDA test case report are not met.

Based on the instructions in `mfda_test_case_generator.md`:
> **If no MFDA integrations found**: "No MFDA integrations detected in codebase - verify scope or check for mainframe integration patterns."

The correct response is to state that no MFDA integrations were detected.
