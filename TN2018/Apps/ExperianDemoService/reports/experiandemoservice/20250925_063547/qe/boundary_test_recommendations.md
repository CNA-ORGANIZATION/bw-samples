An analysis of the provided codebase has been completed. The following report details the findings and recommendations.

## Executive Summary

The system under analysis is a TIBCO BusinessWorks (BW) application, `ExperianService`, which exposes a single REST API endpoint (`/creditscore`) to retrieve a person's credit score based on their Social Security Number (SSN). The analysis reveals several critical boundaries that require rigorous testing. Key risks are associated with the data inputs for the API, the behavior of the backend database query which uses a `LIKE` clause for SSN lookup, and system-level timeouts. Boundary testing is essential to ensure data integrity, prevent potential data leakage from improper SSN matching, and guarantee system stability under edge conditions like database timeouts or when no matching records are found.

## Analysis

### Data Boundary Analysis

The application's primary input is a JSON payload to the `/creditscore` endpoint. The boundaries for these input fields are not explicitly defined, presenting a risk.

**Evidence**:
-   `ExperianService.module/Service Descriptors/experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json`: Defines the API input with `ssn`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `dob` as required strings.
-   `ExperianService.module/Processes/experianservice/module/Process.bwp`: The `JDBCQuery` activity uses the `ssn` field in a `LIKE` clause: `SELECT * FROM public.creditscore where ssn like ?`.

**Impact**:
-   Malformed or unexpected data formats can lead to `ParseJSON` errors or, more critically, unpredictable `JDBCQuery` behavior.
-   Using `LIKE` on an SSN is highly risky; an input like `123%` could return multiple, unrelated records, leading to a data breach. The current process only handles the first record returned, masking this potential issue.
-   Lack of length constraints on string fields could lead to buffer-related issues or database errors.

**Recommendation**:
Implement a comprehensive set of boundary tests for all input fields to validate system behavior with valid, invalid, and edge-case data.

#### Numeric Boundary Test Cases
The database query returns `ficoscore` and `numofpulls` as integers. Testing should validate how the application handles values at and beyond expected business boundaries (e.g., a FICO score is typically 300-850).

| Test Case ID | Description | Test Data | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| DB-NUM-001 | Test minimum valid FICO score | DB `ficoscore` = 300 | `fiCOScore` in response is 300. |
| DB-NUM-002 | Test maximum valid FICO score | DB `ficoscore` = 850 | `fiCOScore` in response is 850. |
| DB-NUM-003 | Test FICO score below valid range | DB `ficoscore` = 299 | `fiCOScore` in response is 299 (system should not error). |
| DB-NUM-004 | Test FICO score of zero | DB `ficoscore` = 0 | `fiCOScore` in response is 0. |
| DB-NUM-005 | Test negative `numofpulls` | DB `numofpulls` = -1 | `noOfInquiries` in response is -1. |
| DB-NUM-006 | Test large `numofpulls` | DB `numofpulls` = `Integer.MAX_VALUE` | `noOfInquiries` in response is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. |

#### String Boundary Test Cases
The `ssn`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `dob` fields are strings with undefined boundaries.

| Test Case ID | Description | Test Data (JSON Input) | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| STR-LEN-001 | Test empty `ssn` | `{"ssn": ""}` | Empty JSON response `{}` or a 400 Bad Request. |
| STR-LEN-002 | Test very long `ssn` | `{"ssn": "[500_chars]"}` | Graceful failure; should not crash the TIBCO process. |
| STR-LEN-003 | Test empty `firstName` | `{"firstName": ""}` | Request is processed, as the field is used for lookup. |
| STR-LEN-004 | Test very long `firstName` | `{"firstName": "[500_chars]"}` | Graceful failure. |
| STR-CHAR-001 | Test `ssn` with SQL wildcards | `{"ssn": "%"}` | Returns the first record found (up to `maxRows`). **High-risk test.** |
| STR-CHAR-002 | Test `ssn` with SQL injection | `{"ssn": "' OR 1=1--"}` | Query should fail or return no results due to parameterization. No data should be returned. |
| STR-CHAR-003 | Test names with special chars | `{"lastName": "O'Malley"}` | Query should execute correctly. |
| STR-CHAR-004 | Test names with Unicode chars | `{"lastName": "MÃ¼ller"}` | Query should execute correctly. |

#### Date/Time Boundary Test Cases
The `dob` field is a string, implying the format is not enforced at the schema level.

| Test Case ID | Description | Test Data (JSON Input) | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| DT-FMT-001 | Test expected date format | `{"dob": "1990-01-15"}` | Request is processed. |
| DT-FMT-002 | Test different valid format | `{"dob": "01/15/1990"}` | Request is processed. |
| DT-FMT-003 | Test invalid format | `{"dob": "15-Jan-1990"}` | Request is processed (as it's a string), but may cause issues if logic expects a specific format. |
| DT-DATE-001 | Test leap year date | `{"dob": "2024-02-29"}` | Request is processed. |
| DT-DATE-002 | Test invalid date | `{"dob": "2023-02-29"}` | Request is processed. |

### System Boundary Analysis

The TIBCO process has configured timeouts and limits that define system boundaries.

**Evidence**:
-   `ExperianService.module/Processes/experianservice/module/Process.bwp`:
    -   `HTTPReceiver` has an `eventTimeout` of `60` seconds.
    -   `JDBCQuery` has a `timeout` of `10` seconds and `maxRows` of `100`.

**Impact**:
-   A database query taking longer than 10 seconds will cause the `JDBCQuery` activity to fail, which is not currently handled, likely resulting in a 500-level error to the client.
-   A request that takes longer than 60 seconds to process will cause the HTTP connection to terminate.
-   If a query on `ssn` matches more than 100 records, only the first 100 will be returned to the TIBCO process, potentially hiding the fact that the query is too broad.

**Recommendation**:
Test the system's behavior at these explicit boundaries to ensure it fails gracefully.

| Test Case ID | Description | Test Scenario | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SYS-DB-001 | Test JDBC timeout | Simulate a DB query that takes > 10 seconds. | The `JDBCQuery` activity should time out. The process should return a specific error response (e.g., 504 Gateway Timeout). |
| SYS-DB-002 | Test `maxRows` limit | Provide an `ssn` pattern that matches > 100 records. | The `JDBCQuery` activity should return exactly 100 records. The process should complete successfully, returning data from the first record. |
| SYS-HTTP-001 | Test HTTP timeout | Introduce a delay in the process (e.g., in the DB query) of > 60 seconds. | The client connection should time out. The TIBCO process may complete but will be unable to send a response. |

### Business Logic Boundary Analysis

The core business logic is the database lookup. The use of `LIKE` instead of an exact match (`=`) is a significant business logic boundary.

**Evidence**:
-   `ExperianService.module/Processes/experianservice/module/Process.bwp`: The `JDBCQuery` activity uses `ssn like ?`.

**Impact**:
-   **Multiple Matches**: If a non-specific `ssn` is provided (e.g., `123-45-%`), the query could match multiple individuals. The process will only return the credit score of the *first* person found in the database, which is arbitrary and likely incorrect. This is a form of data leakage.
-   **No Match**: If the `ssn` does not match any record, the `JDBCQuery` returns an empty result set. The `RenderJSON` activity will produce an empty JSON object (`{}`), which may be confusing to clients expecting specific fields or a 404 Not Found error.

**Recommendation**:
Test these scenarios to document the current (and likely flawed) behavior. Recommend changing the query to use an exact match (`ssn = ?`) and implementing explicit error handling for "not found" cases.

| Test Case ID | Description | Test Data (JSON Input) | Expected Result (Current Behavior) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| BIZ-MATCH-001 | Test no matching record | `{"ssn": "999-99-9999"}` | HTTP 200 OK with an empty JSON body `{}`. |
| BIZ-MATCH-002 | Test single exact match | `{"ssn": "[VALID_SSN]"}` | HTTP 200 OK with the correct credit score data. |
| BIZ-MATCH-003 | Test multiple matches | `{"ssn": "[PATTERN_MATCHING_MULTIPLE]"}` | HTTP 200 OK with the data of the *first* record returned by the database. |

## Evidence Summary

-   **Scope Analyzed**: The analysis focused on the `ExperianService.module`, including its TIBCO process definition (`Process.bwp`), REST service descriptor (`Process-Creditscore.json`), and shared resource configurations for HTTP and JDBC.
-   **Key Data Points**:
    -   API Endpoint: `POST /creditscore`
    -   Input Fields: `ssn`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `dob` (all strings)
    -   Database: PostgreSQL
    -   JDBC Timeout: 10 seconds
    -   JDBC Max Rows: 100
    -   HTTP Timeout: 60 seconds
-   **References**: 5 key files were analyzed to identify the boundaries and logic of the service.

## Assumptions Made

-   The purpose of the service is to retrieve a credit score for a single, specific individual based on their SSN.
-   The `public.creditscore` table in the PostgreSQL database contains columns that map to the fields used in the process (`ficoscore`, `rating`, `numofpulls`, etc.).
-   The `ssn` column in the database is a string type that can be queried with a `LIKE` operator.
-   The TIBCO environment has no global error handling process that would catch the unhandled faults from the `JDBCQuery` activity.

## Open Questions

1.  What are the precise format and length validation rules for the input fields `ssn`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `dob`?
2.  Why was the `LIKE` operator chosen for the SSN lookup instead of an exact match (`=`)? Is pattern matching an intentional feature?
3.  What is the desired system behavior when an SSN matches multiple records? Should it return an error, or is returning the first match acceptable?
4.  What is the desired system behavior when no matching SSN is found? Should the service return an HTTP 404 Not Found or an empty 200 OK?
5.  What are the acceptable business ranges for `fiCOScore` and `noOfInquiries`?

## Confidence Level

**Overall Confidence**: Medium

**Rationale**: The process itself is simple and easy to follow, allowing for a clear identification of technical boundaries like timeouts and row limits. However, the confidence is not "High" due to the significant ambiguity and risk introduced by the `ssn like ?` query. The true behavior and risk of this feature cannot be fully assessed without answers to the open questions regarding its intended use.

**Evidence**:
-   The use of `ssn like ?` is explicitly defined in `ExperianService.module/Processes/experianservice/module/Process.bwp`.
-   The lack of explicit error handling for "no records found" or "query timeout" is visible in the process flow diagram in the same file.
-   The input schema in `experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json` confirms all inputs are generic strings without format or length constraints.

## Action Items

**Immediate** (This Sprint):
-   **[ ] Clarify Business Requirements**: Engage with product owners or business analysts to get answers to the "Open Questions," especially regarding the SSN lookup logic.
-   **[ ] Execute High-Risk Tests**: Manually execute tests BIZ-MATCH-003 and STR-CHAR-001 to confirm the data leakage risk with wildcard SSNs.

**Short-term** (Next 1-2 Sprints):
-   **[ ] Develop Automated Boundary Tests**: Implement the test cases outlined in this report for input validation, system boundaries, and business logic.
-   **[ ] Implement "Not Found" Handling**: Modify the TIBCO process to check if the JDBC query returns any records. If not, return an HTTP 404 response.

**Long-term** (Next Quarter):
-   **[ ] Refactor Database Query**: Based on clarified requirements, change the `JDBCQuery` to use an exact match (`ssn = ?`) to eliminate the data leakage risk.
-   **[ ] Implement Input Validation**: Add a validation step after `ParseJSON` to enforce strict format and length rules for all input fields.

## Risk Assessment

-   **High Risk**:
    -   **Data Leakage**: The use of `ssn like ?` creates a high risk of returning data for the wrong person if a wildcard or partial SSN is provided.
    -   **Unhandled DB Timeouts**: A slow database query will cause an unhandled fault in the process, leading to a generic server error and poor user experience.
-   **Medium Risk**:
    -   **Invalid Input Formats**: Submitting malformed data (especially for `ssn` or `dob`) could cause downstream processing errors or incorrect query results.
    -   **Ambiguous "Not Found" Response**: Returning an empty 200 OK for a non-existent SSN is ambiguous and forces clients to implement extra logic to interpret the response.
-   **Low Risk**:
    -   **Character Set Issues**: Non-ASCII characters in names might cause issues, but this is a lower-impact risk compared to data leakage or system failure.
