## Executive Summary

This report concludes that the requested SOAP-to-SOAP refactoring analysis is **Not Applicable** to the provided `ExperianService` codebase. A detailed review of the project files reveals that the application implements a RESTful API, not a SOAP service. Key evidence includes the use of a Swagger/OpenAPI specification for the service contract and TIBCO BusinessWorks (BW) components designed for REST/JSON processing. Therefore, there are no SOAP endpoints to migrate from mTLS or no-authentication to an API Key-based model.

## Analysis

### Finding: The `ExperianService` is a REST API, Not a SOAP Service

The primary objective was to identify SOAP services using mTLS or no authentication and create a refactoring strategy to secure them with API Keys. However, the analysis confirms the service is built on REST principles.

**Evidence**:

1.  **Service Contract**: The service is defined by a Swagger 2.0 (OpenAPI) specification located at `ExperianService.module/Service Descriptors/experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json`. This file explicitly describes a REST endpoint at `/creditscore` that accepts `POST` requests with a JSON payload. SOAP services are defined by WSDL files, none of which are present.
2.  **TIBCO Process Implementation**: The core business logic in `ExperianService.module/Processes/experianservice/module/Process.bwp` is built using TIBCO BW activities designed for RESTful interactions:
    *   `HTTPReceiver`: Listens for incoming HTTP requests.
    *   `ParseJSON` & `RenderJSON`: Used for processing the request and response payloads, indicating a JSON data format, which is characteristic of REST APIs.
    *   `SendHTTPResponse`: Constructs and sends the final HTTP response.
3.  **Module Dependencies**: The module's manifest file, `ExperianService.module/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`, declares dependencies on TIBCO palettes `bw.restjson` and `bw.http`. It does not list any dependencies on SOAP-related palettes (e.g., `bw.soap`), which would be required for building SOAP services.

**Impact**:

Since the fundamental premise of the analysis—the existence of SOAP services—is incorrect, a SOAP-to-SOAP refactoring strategy cannot be developed for this codebase. The instructions to migrate from mTLS or no-auth to API Keys are irrelevant in this context.

**Recommendation**:

The security posture of the existing REST API should be evaluated independently. The current implementation, as defined in the Swagger file and the TIBCO process, does not appear to enforce any authentication or authorization, making it a potential security risk. A new analysis focused on securing this REST API (e.g., by implementing API Key validation via an API Gateway like Apigee or within the TIBCO process itself) should be commissioned.

## Evidence Summary

*   **Scope Analyzed**: All files related to the `ExperianService` and `ExperianService.module` projects.
*   **Key Data Points**:
    *   **0 WSDL files found**, indicating no SOAP services.
    *   **1 Swagger/OpenAPI JSON file found**, confirming a REST API contract.
    *   The TIBCO process exclusively uses REST/HTTP/JSON activities.
    *   Module dependencies confirm the use of REST/JSON palettes and the absence of SOAP palettes.

## Assumptions Made

*   The provided files for `ExperianService` represent the complete and accurate codebase for the service in question.
*   The goal of the original request was to improve the security of service integrations, which was misidentified as a SOAP-to-SOAP refactoring task.

## Open Questions

*   Was the `ExperianService` incorrectly identified as a SOAP service, or was this the wrong codebase for the requested analysis?
*   What is the intended security model for the existing `ExperianService` REST API?
*   Are there other services within the application ecosystem that do use SOAP and were intended for this analysis?

## Confidence Level

**Overall Confidence**: High

**Rationale**: The evidence is conclusive and unambiguous. The project structure, service contract, implementation logic, and declared dependencies all consistently point to a RESTful service architecture. There is no conflicting evidence to suggest the presence of any SOAP components.

## Action Items

*   **Immediate**:
    *   [ ] **Clarify Scope**: Confirm with stakeholders whether the `ExperianService` was misidentified or if a different codebase should have been provided for the SOAP refactoring analysis.
    *   [ ] **Re-evaluate Request**: Determine if the actual goal is to secure the existing `ExperianService` REST API. If so, a new analysis focused on REST API security should be initiated.

## Risk Assessment

Not applicable, as the conditions for the requested risk assessment (migrating SOAP services) do not exist in this codebase.
