Not Applicable - No SOAP endpoints require refactoring, no QE testing strategy is needed.

### Analysis Summary

A comprehensive analysis of the provided `ExperianService` codebase was conducted to generate a QE Testing Strategy for a SOAP-to-SOAP refactoring. The analysis revealed that the project does not contain any SOAP services. Instead, it implements a RESTful API.

**Evidence:**

*   **Service Definition**: The file `ExperianService.module/Service Descriptors/experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json` is a Swagger 2.0 (OpenAPI) definition, which is used for describing RESTful APIs, not SOAP web services.
*   **Process Implementation**: The core business logic in `ExperianService.module/Processes/experianservice/module/Process.bwp` utilizes TIBCO BusinessWorks activities specific to REST/JSON processing, such as `HTTPReceiver`, `ParseJSON`, and `RenderJSON`. There are no SOAP-related activities (e.g., SOAP Request/Reply) present.
*   **Module Dependencies**: The module manifest `ExperianService.module/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` declares dependencies on TIBCO palettes for `bw.restjson` and `bw.http`, but not `bw.soap`.

Given that the fundamental prerequisite for the report—the existence of SOAP services to refactor—is not met, a QE testing strategy for a SOAP-to-SOAP migration is not applicable to this codebase.
