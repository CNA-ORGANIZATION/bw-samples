## Migration Overview (from original report)
This report outlines a comprehensive Quality Engineering (QE) testing strategy for the migration of the `ExperianService` TIBCO BusinessWorks (BW) application to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The migration involves refactoring the TIBCO BW process into a cloud-native service (e.g., Cloud Run), migrating the backend PostgreSQL database to AlloyDB, and exposing the service via a modern API gateway.

## Affected Source Files Analysis
-   **ExperianService.module/Processes/experianservice/module/Process.bwp**: Defines the workflow: HTTP In -> Parse JSON -> JDBC Query -> Render JSON -> HTTP Out.
-   **ExperianService.module/Resources/experianservice/module/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource**: Specifies a connection to a PostgreSQL database (`org.postgresql.Driver`, `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/bookstore`).
-   **ExperianService.module/Service Descriptors/experianservice.module.Process-Creditscore.json**: Defines the `POST /creditscore` REST endpoint.

## Specific Code Changes Required (Testing Perspective)
1.  **GCP Service Connectivity & Logic Validation**:
    *   The migrated TIBCO BW process (e.g., as a new Cloud Run service or Cloud Function) must be tested in isolation.
    *   **Test Case**: Invoke the service with a mock database connection to verify that it correctly parses input, constructs the SQL query, and renders the output JSON according to the schemas (`ExperianRequestSchema.xsd`, `ExperianResponseSchemaResource.xsd`).
2.  **Database Migration Validation (PostgreSQL to AlloyDB)**:
    *   **Test Case**: Execute the core SQL query (`SELECT * FROM public.creditscore where ssn like ?`) found in `Process.bwp` directly against the migrated AlloyDB instance to ensure it returns the correct data structure and results.
    *   **Test Case**: Validate that the AlloyDB schema matches the source PostgreSQL schema, including table definitions, constraints, and indexes.
3.  **Security Configuration Testing**:
    *   **Test Case**: Verify the new cloud service is deployed with a service account that has the principle of least privilege applied (e.g., only `AlloyDB Client` role).
    *   **Test Case**: Confirm that credentials for AlloyDB are fetched from GCP Secret Manager and not hardcoded in the application configuration.
4.  **Business Workflow Validation**:
    *   **Test Scenario**: Create an automated end-to-end test that sends a `POST` request to the new GCP endpoint for `/creditscore`. The test should assert that the HTTP 200 response is received and that the `fiCOScore`, `rating`, and `noOfInquiries` fields in the JSON response match the expected values from the AlloyDB database for the given SSN.
5.  **Performance & Scalability Testing**:
    *   **Test Case**: Establish a performance baseline by load testing the existing TIBCO BW service.
    *   **Test Case**: Execute an identical load test against the new GCP-based service. The target should be to meet or exceed the baseline performance (e.g., p95 latency < 200ms, throughput of 500 requests/sec).
    *   **Test Case**: Conduct a stress test to identify the breaking point of the new service and validate that autoscaling (if configured) functions correctly.
6.  **Data Integrity & Consistency Testing**:
    *   **Test Case**: Create a data validation tool that queries a large sample of records (e.g., 100,000 SSNs) from both the source PostgreSQL database and the migrated AlloyDB instance. The tool must perform a field-by-field comparison of the results and report any discrepancies. The success criterion is a 100% match.
7.  **Production Performance Monitoring**:
    *   **Task**: Before go-live, configure Cloud Monitoring dashboards to track key metrics for the new service: latency (p50, p90, p99), error rate, request count, and instance utilization.
    *   **Test Case**: During a canary release, validate that the monitoring dashboards accurately reflect the traffic and performance of the service.
8.  **Data Quality Monitoring**:
    *   **Task**: Implement a scheduled job that runs a small set of data integrity checks against the production AlloyDB instance and alerts on any anomalies.
9.  **Rollback Procedure Validation**:
    *   **Test Case**: Conduct a dry run of the rollback plan. This involves simulating a critical failure and executing the procedure to redirect traffic from the new GCP service back to the legacy TIBCO endpoint. The test must validate that the switch occurs within the defined RTO (e.g., < 5 minutes) and with no data loss.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide (Testing)
1.  **Set up a test environment** that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.
2.  **Deploy the new GCP service** to the test environment.
3.  **Migrate a copy of the production data** to the test AlloyDB instance.
4.  **Implement the component tests** to validate the individual components of the new service.
5.  **Implement the integration tests** to validate the integration between the new service and AlloyDB.
6.  **Implement the end-to-end tests** to validate the entire workflow.
7.  **Implement the performance tests** to ensure the new service meets the performance requirements.
8.  **Implement the security tests** to verify that the API Key validation is working correctly.
9.  **Configure the monitoring dashboards** to track the performance of the new service in production.
10. **Implement the data quality monitoring job** to detect any data anomalies.
11. **Validate the rollback procedure** to ensure that it works correctly.

## Before/After Code Examples (Testing)
(Since the testing strategy involves setting up test cases and environments, there are no direct code examples to compare. The focus is on validating the behavior and performance of the new service.)

## Dependencies and Configuration Updates (Testing)
-   **Dependencies**:
    -   Test automation framework (e.g., JUnit, TestNG)
    -   Load testing tool (e.g., JMeter, Gatling)
    -   GCP Cloud Monitoring
    -   GCP Secret Manager
-   **Configuration Updates**:
    -   Configure the test automation framework to connect to the test AlloyDB instance.
    -   Configure the load testing tool to send requests to the new GCP service.
    -   Configure the monitoring dashboards to track the performance of the new service.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation (Testing)
-   **Risk**: Data loss during database migration.
    -   **Mitigation**: Implement a data validation tool to compare the data in the source and target databases.
-   **Risk**: Performance degradation.
    -   **Mitigation**: Load test the new service to ensure it meets the performance requirements.
-   **Risk**: Security vulnerability due to missing authentication.
    -   **Mitigation**: Implement security tests to verify that the API Key validation is working correctly.

## Additional Notes and Considerations (Testing)
-   Automate as much of the testing process as possible.
-   Use a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the deployment and testing of the new service.
-   Monitor the performance of the new service in production and make adjustments as needed.
