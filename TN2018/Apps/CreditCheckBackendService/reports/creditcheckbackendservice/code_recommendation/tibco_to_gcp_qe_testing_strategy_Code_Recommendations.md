## Code Recommendations for TIBCO to GCP QE Testing Strategy

Based on the analysis of the `CreditCheckService` application, the following code recommendations are provided for the Quality Engineering (QE) testing strategy for the migration of the TIBCO BusinessWorks (BW) application to Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

### 1. GCP Service Connectivity Testing

**Migration Overview:**

Verify that the containerized TIBCO BW application (deployed on Cloud Run or GKE) can securely connect to the target AlloyDB instance and GCP Secret Manager.

**Affected Source Files Analysis:**

*   N/A - This is a testing strategy, not a code migration.

**Specific Code Changes Required:**

N/A - This is a testing strategy, not a code migration.

**Step-by-Step Implementation Guide:**

1.  **Establish a database connection using the new IAM service account and updated JDBC connection strings.**
    *   Example (Java with Spring Boot):

        ```java
        @Autowired
        private DataSource dataSource;

        @Test
        public void testDatabaseConnection() throws SQLException {
            try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection()) {
                assertTrue(connection.isValid(5)); // Timeout of 5 seconds
            }
        }
        ```

2.  **Confirm the application can fetch database credentials from GCP Secret Manager at runtime.**
    *   Example (Java with Spring Boot):

        ```java
        @Autowired
        private SecretManagerServiceClient client;

        @Value("${spring.cloud.gcp.secretmanager.secret-name}")
        private String secretName;

        @Test
        public void testSecretManagerAccess() throws IOException {
            SecretVersionName secretVersionName = SecretVersionName.of("<project-id>", secretName, "latest");
            AccessSecretVersionResponse response = client.accessSecretVersion(secretVersionName);
            String secretValue = response.getPayload().getData().toStringUtf8();
            assertNotNull(secretValue);
            assertFalse(secretValue.isEmpty());
        }
        ```

3.  **Validate VPC-SC and firewall rules by attempting connections from authorized and unauthorized sources.**
    *   This requires infrastructure setup and network testing tools.

**Before/After Code Examples:**

*   N/A - This is a testing strategy, not a code migration.

**Dependencies and Configuration Updates:**

*   Add dependencies for Spring Boot, JDBC, PostgreSQL driver, and Spring Cloud GCP Secret Manager.
*   Configure the application to connect to the AlloyDB instance and GCP Secret Manager.

**Testing and Validation Steps:**

*   Run the tests to verify database connection and Secret Manager access.
*   Manually test network connectivity from different sources.

**Risk Assessment and Mitigation:**

*   Improperly configured IAM roles or network policies could expose the database or the service endpoint.

**Additional Notes and Considerations:**

*   Use a dedicated test environment for these tests.

### 2. Database Migration Validation (DB2 to AlloyDB)

**Migration Overview:**

Ensure that the SQL logic within the TIBCO processes functions correctly against AlloyDB and that the initial data load is accurate.

**Affected Source Files Analysis:**

*   `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/LookupDatabase.bwp`: Contains the SQL queries.

**Specific Code Changes Required:**

N/A - This is a testing strategy, not a code migration.

**Step-by-Step Implementation Guide:**

1.  **Create unit tests that execute the migrated SQL queries directly against an AlloyDB test instance to verify syntax and behavior.**
    *   Example (Java with Spring Boot):

        ```java
        @Autowired
        private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

        @Test
        public void testSqlQuery() {
            String sql = "select * from public.creditscore where ssn like ?";
            String ssn = "123-45-6789";
            List<Map<String, Object>> results = jdbcTemplate.queryForList(sql, ssn);
            assertFalse(results.isEmpty());
        }
        ```

2.  **Test with a dataset that covers all data types in the `creditscore` table to ensure no precision loss or format corruption occurred during migration (e.g., numeric, string, integer types for `ficoscore`, `rating`, `numofpulls`).**
    *   This requires creating a test dataset and validating the data types.

3.  **Perform a checksum or row-count comparison between the source DB2 `creditscore` table and the migrated AlloyDB table.**
    *   This requires access to both databases and a data comparison tool.

**Before/After Code Examples:**

*   N/A - This is a testing strategy, not a code migration.

**Dependencies and Configuration Updates:**

*   Add the JDBC dependency.
*   Configure the application to connect to the AlloyDB test instance.

**Testing and Validation Steps:**

*   Run the tests to verify SQL query execution and data integrity.
*   Compare the checksum or row count between the source and target databases.

**Risk Assessment and Mitigation:**

*   Data corruption during migration could lead to incorrect credit checks.

**Additional Notes and Considerations:**

*   Use a dedicated test environment for these tests.

### 3. Business Workflow Validation

**Migration Overview:**

Ensure the end-to-end `creditscore` business process functions as expected after migration.

**Affected Source Files Analysis:**

*   `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/Process.bwp`: Defines the REST endpoint and process flow.
*   `CreditCheckService/Service Descriptors/creditcheckservice.Process-CreditScore.json`: Defines the REST API contract.

**Specific Code Changes Required:**

N/A - This is a testing strategy, not a code migration.

**Step-by-Step Implementation Guide:**

1.  **Develop an automated E2E test suite that simulates client requests with various SSNs.**
    *   Example (Java with Spring Boot and REST-assured):

        ```java
        @Test
        public void testCreditScoreLookup() {
            given()
                .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
                .body("{\"SSN\":\"123-45-6789\"}")
            .when()
                .post("/creditscore")
            .then()
                .statusCode(200)
                .body("FICOScore", notNullValue())
                .body("Rating", notNullValue())
                .body("NoOfInquiries", notNullValue());
        }
        ```

2.  **Validate that for a given SSN, the correct FICO score, rating, and number of inquiries are returned.**
    *   This requires a test dataset with known values.

3.  **Verify that the `numofpulls` column is correctly incremented in the AlloyDB `creditscore` table after each successful request.**
    *   This requires querying the database after each request.

4.  **Test the error handling path where an invalid SSN results in a 404 error, as defined in `Process.bwp`.**
    *   Example (Java with Spring Boot and REST-assured):

        ```java
        @Test
        public void testInvalidSsn() {
            given()
                .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
                .body("{\"SSN\":\"999-99-9999\"}")
            .when()
                .post("/creditscore")
            .then()
                .statusCode(404);
        }
        ```

**Before/After Code Examples:**

*   N/A - This is a testing strategy, not a code migration.

**Dependencies and Configuration Updates:**

*   Add dependencies for REST-assured and JUnit.
*   Configure the application to connect to the AlloyDB test instance.

**Testing and Validation Steps:**

*   Run the E2E tests to verify the business workflow.
*   Query the database to verify data integrity.

**Risk Assessment and Mitigation:**

*   Business logic failures could lead to incorrect credit scores.

**Additional Notes and Considerations:**

*   Use a dedicated test environment for these tests.

### 4. Performance & Scalability Testing
