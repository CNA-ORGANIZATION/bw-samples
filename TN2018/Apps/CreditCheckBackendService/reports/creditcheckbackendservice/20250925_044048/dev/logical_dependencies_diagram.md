## Executive Summary
This analysis maps the logical dependencies and integration points for the `CreditCheckService` application. The system is a TIBCO BusinessWorks (BW) application that exposes a single REST API endpoint to perform credit checks. Its primary dependency is a PostgreSQL database, which it uses to look up and update credit score information. The architecture is straightforward, consisting of a REST service that triggers a business process, which in turn calls a subprocess to handle all database interactions.

## Analysis

### System Overview
The `CreditCheckService` is an integration application built on TIBCO BusinessWorks. It functions as a backend service, providing credit score information. The system receives a Social Security Number (SSN) via a REST API call, queries a PostgreSQL database for the corresponding credit data, updates an inquiry counter in the same database, and returns the credit information to the caller. The core logic is encapsulated within two TIBCO BW processes.

### Integration Details Table

| Component | Integration Type | Target System | Protocol/Method | Purpose | Evidence |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------|----------|
| `creditcheckservice.Process` | Inbound API | `CreditCheckService` | REST (HTTP POST) | To receive credit check requests containing an SSN and return a credit score. | `CreditCheckService/META-INF/module.bwm` |
| `creditcheckservice.LookupDatabase` | Database | PostgreSQL | JDBC | To query for credit information by SSN and update the number of inquiries (`numofpulls`). | `CreditCheckService/Resources/creditcheckservice/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource`, `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/LookupDatabase.bwp` |

### Undetermined Elements

-   **External Client Details**: The codebase defines the service that receives requests, but it does not specify what system or application acts as the client.
-   **Database Host & Credentials**: The JDBC connection URL is managed by a module property `BWCE.DB.URL`. The configuration files (`default.substvar`, `docker.substvar`) contain placeholder hostnames like `abc`, `kuchbhi`, and `awagle`. The actual hostnames for different environments are not defined in the repository. The password in `JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` is encrypted.
-   **Database Schema Definition**: The process `LookupDatabase.bwp` executes SQL against a table named `public.creditscore`. While the queries reveal column names like `ssn`, `ficoscore`, `rating`, and `numofpulls`, the complete table schema (DDL) is not included in the codebase.
-   **Unused REST Reference**: The main process (`Process.bwp`) contains a WSDL definition for a partner link to an external REST service at `192.168.64.3:30068`. However, the process flow does not invoke this service, suggesting it may be dead code or a placeholder for a future feature.
-   **TIBCO Cloud Integration**: The file `repository.json` references `https://integration.cloud.tibco.com:443`. This appears to be a development-time dependency for managing service descriptors and is not part of the runtime application data flow.

## Evidence Summary
-   **Scope Analyzed**: All TIBCO project files, including `.bwp` (processes), `.jdbcResource` (DB connections), `.substvar` (configurations), and service descriptors (JSON/XSD).
-   **Key Data Points**:
    -   1 Inbound REST API endpoint (`/creditscore`).
    -   1 external database dependency (PostgreSQL).
    -   2 distinct database operations (SELECT and UPDATE) on the `creditscore` table.
-   **References**: The analysis is based on the explicit configurations and process flows defined in `module.bwm`, `JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource`, and `LookupDatabase.bwp`.

## Assumptions Made
-   It is assumed that the `creditcheckservice.Process` is the primary entry point for all business functionality in this application.
-   It is assumed that the JDBC connection configured is the only data persistence mechanism used by the application at runtime.
-   The `LookupDatabase.bwp` is a subprocess and is not intended to be called directly from outside the main `Process.bwp`.

## Open Questions
-   What are the specific hostnames and credentials for the PostgreSQL database in each environment (DEV, TEST, PROD)?
-   What is the complete schema for the `public.creditscore` table, including data types, constraints, and indexes?
-   Is the unused REST reference to `192.168.64.3:30068` in `Process.bwp` obsolete and can it be removed?
-   Who are the intended clients of the `/creditscore` API endpoint?

## Confidence Level
**Overall Confidence**: High

**Rationale**: The codebase is small and self-contained, making the dependency analysis straightforward. The TIBCO process files (`.bwp`) and shared resource configurations (`.jdbcResource`) explicitly define the integration points and data flow. The primary dependencies (REST endpoint and JDBC connection) are clearly implemented. The only ambiguity relates to external configuration values and unused code, which does not affect the core dependency map.

**Evidence**:
-   **REST Service**: `CreditCheckService/META-INF/module.bwm` clearly defines the `<sca:service name="creditscore">` with a `<rest:RestServiceBinding>`.
-   **Database Connection**: `CreditCheckService/Resources/creditcheckservice/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` specifies the use of `org.postgresql.Driver` and the `BWCE.DB.URL` property.
-   **Data Flow**: `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/Process.bwp` shows a call to the `creditcheckservice.LookupDatabase` subprocess. `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/LookupDatabase.bwp` contains the `JDBCQuery` and `JDBCUpdate` activities with their respective SQL statements.

## Action Items
**Immediate** (Next 1-2 days):
-   [ ] Confirm the purpose of the unused REST reference in `Process.bwp` and schedule its removal if it is obsolete.

**Short-term** (Next Sprint):
-   [ ] Document the full schema for the `public.creditscore` table in a shared location.
-   [ ] Create a secure and centralized configuration plan to manage the `BWCE.DB.URL` property for all environments, removing placeholder values from the repository.

**Long-term** (Next Quarter):
-   [ ] Develop a monitoring strategy for the PostgreSQL database dependency to track query performance and availability.

## Risk Assessment
-   **High Risk**: **Configuration Errors**. Since the database URL is managed by environment-specific variables, there is a high risk of misconfiguration during deployment, which would cause the entire service to fail.
-   **Medium Risk**: **Database Performance**. The service's performance is directly tied to the performance of the two queries against the `creditscore` table. Without proper indexing on the `ssn` column, the service could become a bottleneck under load.
-   **Low Risk**: **API Contract Changes**. As the service is simple, any change to the API contract would be a breaking change for clients. However, the risk is low due to the simplicity of the request/response model.
