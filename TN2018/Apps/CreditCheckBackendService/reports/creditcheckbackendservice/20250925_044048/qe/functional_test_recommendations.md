## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive functional testing strategy for the `CreditCheckService` application. The analysis reveals that the application is a TIBCO BusinessWorks (BW) service designed to perform credit score lookups against a PostgreSQL database. The core functionality involves receiving a Social Security Number (SSN) via a REST API, querying a database for the corresponding credit record, incrementing an inquiry counter (`numofpulls`), and returning the credit details.

Given the financial nature of the service and its handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), testing must be prioritized around data integrity, error handling, and the critical path of a successful lookup. The highest priority (P0) tests should validate the accuracy of the credit score lookup and the atomic update of the inquiry count. The current implementation's tendency to return a `404 Not Found` for all failure types, including internal database errors, represents a significant risk and a key area for validation and potential clarification.

## Analysis

### Functional Test Plan

This test plan outlines the scope, strategy, and specific test cases required to ensure the functional quality of the `CreditCheckService`.

#### 1. Functional Testing Scope Analysis

Based on the codebase, the following functional areas have been identified for testing:

*   **Core Business Process**:
    *   Credit Score Retrieval: Look up a user's credit information based on their SSN.
    *   Inquiry Tracking: Increment the number of credit inquiries (`numofpulls`) for each successful lookup.

*   **User Workflows**:
    *   A client system (e.g., a web application) submits a request with user details (primarily SSN) to the `/creditscore` endpoint.
    *   The service processes the request, interacts with the database, and returns the credit score information or an error.

*   **Business Rules**:
    *   A credit record must exist for the provided SSN to return a successful response.
    *   If a record is not found, the service must return a "Not Found" error.
    *   For every successful lookup, the `numofpulls` counter in the database for that SSN must be incremented by one.
    *   Any internal processing failure (e.g., database connection error) should be handled gracefully.

*   **Feature Functionality**:
    *   **API Functionality**: A single `POST /creditscore` REST endpoint that accepts a JSON payload.
    *   **Database Integration**: The service performs `SELECT` and `UPDATE` operations on a `creditscore` table in a PostgreSQL database.
    *   **Error Handling**: A global `catchAll` block handles exceptions, logs a failure message, and returns a `404 Not Found` response.

#### 2. Risk-Based Test Scenario Prioritization

Testing efforts are prioritized based on business impact and risk.

*   **P0 - Critical Business Workflows (70% of effort)**: These tests focus on the primary revenue and data-integrity path. Failures here have a direct business impact.
    *   Successful credit score lookup and response validation.
    *   Correct incrementing of the `numofpulls` counter.
    *   Correct handling of a non-existent SSN (the primary negative path).
    *   Transactional integrity (lookup and update should be atomic).

*   **P1 - High-Impact User Workflows (20% of effort)**: These tests cover crucial error handling and API contract validation.
    *   Handling of database connection failures.
    *   Validation of request and response JSON schemas.
    *   Handling of invalid or malformed request payloads.

*   **P2 - Medium-Impact Features (10% of effort)**: These tests validate secondary functionality like logging.
    *   Verification of success and failure log messages.

*   **P3 - Low-Impact Features (0% of effort)**: No low-impact features were identified that warrant dedicated functional testing in the initial phase.

#### 3. Functional Test Cases (Given/When/Then)

The following test cases are designed to validate the functionality identified in the scope analysis, prioritized by risk.

##### **P0 - Critical Business Workflows**

```gherkin
# P0 Critical Path - Successful Credit Score Lookup
Feature: Credit Score Retrieval
  Scenario: Successful lookup for an existing customer
    Given the 'creditscore' database table contains a record for SSN "[REDACTED_SSN_1]" with "numofpulls" = 5
    When a POST request is made to "/creditscore" with the following JSON body:
      """
      { "SSN": "[REDACTED_SSN_1]" }
      """
    Then the API response status code should be 200 (OK)
    And the response body should be a JSON object containing the correct "FICOScore", "Rating", and "NoOfInquiries" from the database record.
    And the "numofpulls" value for SSN "[REDACTED_SSN_1]" in the 'creditscore' table should be updated to 6.

# P0 Critical Path - Non-Existent Customer
  Scenario: Lookup for a non-existent customer
    Given the 'creditscore' database table does not contain a record for SSN "[REDACTED_SSN_2]"
    When a POST request is made to "/creditscore" with the following JSON body:
      """
      { "SSN": "[REDACTED_SSN_2]" }
      """
    Then the API response status code should be 404 (Not Found).
    And the "LogFailure" activity should log the message "Invocation Failed".

# P0 Data Integrity - Concurrent Lookups
  Scenario: Two concurrent lookups for the same customer
    Given the 'creditscore' database table contains a record for SSN "[REDACTED_SSN_3]" with "numofpulls" = 10
    When two simultaneous POST requests are made to "/creditscore" for SSN "[REDACTED_SSN_3]"
    Then both API responses should return a status code of 200 (OK).
    And the final "numofpulls" value for SSN "[REDACTED_SSN_3]" in the 'creditscore' table should be 12.
```

##### **P1 - High-Impact User Workflows**

```gherkin
# P1 Failure Scenario - Database Unavailability
Feature: System Resilience
  Scenario: Service behavior when the database is down
    Given the PostgreSQL database is not accessible from the TIBCO application
    When a POST request is made to "/creditscore" with a valid SSN
    Then the API response status code should be 404 (Not Found).
    And the "LogFailure" activity should log the message "Invocation Failed".
    # Note: This behavior should be questioned. A 503 Service Unavailable might be more appropriate.

# P1 API Contract - Invalid Request Payload
  Scenario: Request with malformed JSON
    Given the service is running
    When a POST request is made to "/creditscore" with a malformed JSON body (e.g., missing closing brace)
    Then the API response status code should be 400 (Bad Request).
    # Note: This tests the default behavior of the REST binding, as no explicit validation is in the process.

# P1 API Contract - Missing Required Field
  Scenario: Request with missing SSN field
    Given the service is running
    When a POST request is made to "/creditscore" with the following JSON body:
      """
      { "FirstName": "John" }
      """
    Then the API response status code should be 404 (Not Found).
    # Note: The process will likely fail on the DB query with a null SSN, triggering the catchAll block.
    # This is another behavior that should be questioned. A 400 Bad Request would be better.
```

##### **P2 - Medium-Impact Features**

```gherkin
# P2 Logging Verification
Feature: Application Logging
  Scenario: Successful invocation logging
    Given a valid SSN exists in the database
    When a successful POST request is made to "/creditscore" for that SSN
    Then the "LogSuccess" activity should log the message "Invoation Successful".
    # Typo "Invoation" is present in the source file and should be tested as is, then flagged for correction.
```

#### 4. Test Data Requirements

To execute the above test cases, the following test data is required in the `public.creditscore` table:

| SSN (Primary Key) | firstname | lastname | dateofBirth | ficoscore | rating    | numofpulls | Test Case(s)                               |
| :---------------- | :-------- | :------- | :---------- | :-------- | :-------- | :--------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| [REDACTED_SSN_1]  | 'John'    | 'Doe'    | '1980-01-15'| 750       | 'Good'    | 5          | P0 - Successful Lookup                     |
| [REDACTED_SSN_3]  | 'Jane'    | 'Smith'  | '1992-05-20'| 810       | 'Excellent'| 10         | P0 - Concurrent Lookups                    |
| [REDACTED_SSN_4]  | 'Peter'   | 'Jones'  | '1975-11-30'| 620       | 'Fair'    | 0          | P0 - Initial lookup (to become 1)          |
| [REDACTED_SSN_5]  | 'Mary'    | 'Jane'   | '2000-02-29'| 790       | 'Very Good'| 99         | P1 - Boundary test for `numofpulls`        |

*   **Negative Data**: Any SSN not in the table, such as `[REDACTED_SSN_2]`, will serve for "Not Found" scenarios.
*   **Invalid Data**: Test cases for invalid request bodies do not require pre-existing database records.

## Evidence Summary

*   **Scope Analyzed**: The analysis focused on the TIBCO BusinessWorks application `CreditCheckService` and its constituent processes and resources.
*   **Key Files Analyzed**:
    *   `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/Process.bwp`: The main process that exposes the REST endpoint and orchestrates the workflow.
    *   `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/LookupDatabase.bwp`: The subprocess containing the core database query and update logic.
    *   `CreditCheckService/Resources/creditcheckservice/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource`: Defines the PostgreSQL database connection, driver, and credentials.
    *   `CreditCheckService/Service Descriptors/creditcheckservice.Process-CreditScore.json`: The Swagger/OpenAPI definition for the `/creditscore` REST service.
*   **Key Data Points**:
    *   1 primary business workflow (Credit Score Lookup).
    *   1 REST endpoint (`POST /creditscore`).
    *   2 database operations (`SELECT` and `UPDATE`) on a single table.
    *   1 global error handling path (`catchAll`).

## Assumptions Made

*   It is assumed that the `public.creditscore` table exists in the PostgreSQL database and its schema includes columns for `ssn`, `ficoscore`, `rating`, and `numofpulls`.
*   It is assumed that the `numofpulls` column is of a numeric type (e.g., INTEGER) that can be incremented.
*   The analysis assumes that the TIBCO environment has the necessary JDBC drivers for PostgreSQL installed and configured.
*   The current error handling, which maps all internal exceptions to a `404 Not Found` response, is the intended (though questionable) design.

## Open Questions

*   **Error Handling**: Is returning a `404 Not Found` for internal server errors (like a database failure) the desired behavior? Standard practice would suggest a `5xx` series error (e.g., `503 Service Unavailable`) to distinguish from a simple "record not found" case.
*   **Concurrency**: The `UPDATE` statement for `numofpulls` is not explicitly protected against race conditions. Is the transaction isolation level of the database sufficient to guarantee atomicity, or should pessimistic/optimistic locking be considered in the application logic?
*   **Input Validation**: There is no explicit validation on the input SSN format within the TIBCO process. Should the service validate the format before querying the database?
*   **Typo in Log**: The success log message is "Invoation Successful". Is this a typo that should be corrected?

## Confidence Level

**Overall Confidence**: High

**Rationale**: The application is self-contained and has a single, well-defined business purpose. The logic is concentrated in two process files (`Process.bwp` and `LookupDatabase.bwp`), making the critical path easy to trace. The database interactions are simple `SELECT` and `UPDATE` statements. The evidence from the TIBCO process definitions and resource configurations provides a clear and complete picture of the application's functionality.

## Action Items

**Immediate (Next 1-3 Days)**:
*   [ ] Implement and automate the P0 test cases for the happy path (successful lookup) and the primary negative path (SSN not found).
*   [ ] Set up a test database with the required test data as specified in the "Test Data Requirements" section.

**Short-term (Next Sprint)**:
*   [ ] Implement and automate the P1 test cases, including scenarios for database unavailability and invalid request payloads.
*   [ ] Discuss the "Open Questions" with the development and product teams to clarify the expected error handling behavior (404 vs. 500-level errors).

**Long-term (Next 1-2 Months)**:
*   [ ] Develop a full, automated regression suite covering all P0 and P1 scenarios.
*   [ ] Integrate the automated test suite into a CI/CD pipeline to run on every code change.
*   [ ] Investigate and implement performance tests to validate response times under load.

## Risk Assessment

*   **High Risk**:
    *   **Data Integrity Failure**: A race condition or transactional error could cause the `numofpulls` to be incremented incorrectly, leading to inaccurate inquiry tracking.
    *   **Incorrect Error Communication**: The current design of returning `404 Not Found` for all errors could mislead client systems, causing them to treat a temporary database failure as a permanent "user not found" condition.

*   **Medium Risk**:
    *   **Service Outage**: A database connection failure will render the entire service non-functional. The lack of a specific error code for this makes automated recovery by clients difficult.

*   **Low Risk**:
    *   **Logging Errors**: A failure in the logging activity would not impact the core business function but would reduce observability.
    *   **Typographical Error**: The "Invoation" typo in the log message is a minor quality issue with no functional impact.
