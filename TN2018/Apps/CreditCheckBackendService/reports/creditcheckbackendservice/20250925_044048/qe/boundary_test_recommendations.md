## Executive Summary

The `CreditCheckService` application presents several critical, untested boundaries that pose significant risks to data integrity, performance, and reliability. The primary areas of concern are the lack of input validation on the public-facing REST API, the use of a `LIKE` clause for Social Security Number (SSN) lookups which can lead to incorrect data processing, and untested numeric boundaries for core business data like FICO scores and the number of inquiries. This report outlines a comprehensive boundary testing strategy to identify and mitigate these risks.

## Analysis

### Data Boundary Analysis

The application's primary function is to receive a request for a credit check, query a database, and return a credit score. This process involves several data boundaries that require rigorous testing.

#### Numeric Boundary Test Cases

**Evidence**: The `creditcheckservice.LookupDatabase.bwp` process queries a `creditscore` table containing `ficoscore` and `numofpulls` integer columns. The `ficoscore` is a standard credit metric with a known range, and `numofpulls` is incremented with each query, creating a risk of overflow.

**Impact**: Incorrect handling of FICO scores outside the expected range could lead to invalid business decisions. An overflow in the `numofpulls` count could cause data corruption or transaction failures.

**Recommendation**: Implement and automate the following test cases for numeric fields.

| Field | Test Case Description | Input Value | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ficoscore` | Minimum valid score | 300 | Processed correctly. |
| `ficoscore` | Maximum valid score | 850 | Processed correctly. |
| `ficoscore` | Below minimum boundary | 299 | System handles gracefully (e.g., validation error, default rating). |
| `ficoscore` | Above maximum boundary | 851 | System handles gracefully. |
| `ficoscore` | Zero value | 0 | System handles gracefully. |
| `ficoscore` | Negative value | -100 | System handles gracefully. |
| `numofpulls` | Maximum integer value | `Integer.MAX_VALUE` | The `UPDATE` query succeeds. |
| `numofpulls` | Integer overflow | Request that increments `numofpulls` from `Integer.MAX_VALUE` | The system handles the overflow without crashing; ideally, it logs an error and caps the value. |

#### String Boundary Test Cases

**Evidence**: The REST API defined in `creditcheckservice.Process-CreditScore.json` accepts `SSN`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `DOB` as strings. The `LookupDatabase.bwp` process uses the `SSN` in a `WHERE ssn like ?` clause, which is highly susceptible to boundary and injection-style attacks.

**Impact**: Lack of validation on string inputs can lead to SQL injection, poor performance from wildcard abuse, and incorrect record matching if multiple records are returned. Invalid formats for `DOB` can cause processing errors.

**Recommendation**: Implement and automate the following test cases for string inputs.

| Field | Test Case Description | Input Value | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SSN` | Empty string | `""` | API returns a 400 Bad Request or validation error. No DB query is performed. |
| `SSN` | Very long string | A string of 1000+ characters. | API returns a 400 Bad Request. No DB query is performed. |
| `SSN` | SQL wildcard (`%`) | `"%"` | API returns a 400 Bad Request or the query is sanitized. A full table scan must be prevented. |
| `SSN` | SQL wildcard (`_`) | `"_"` | API returns a 400 Bad Request or the query is sanitized. |
| `SSN` | Non-numeric characters | `"abc-de-fghi"` | API returns a 400 Bad Request. |
| `DOB` | Invalid date format | `"2023/01/01"` | API returns a 400 Bad Request. |
| `DOB` | Impossible date | `"02/30/2023"` | API returns a 400 Bad Request. |
| `FirstName` | Special characters | `"O'Malley"` | Name is handled correctly without causing SQL errors. |
| `LastName` | Unicode characters | `"GarcÃ­a"` | Name is handled correctly. |

### System Boundary Analysis

The application has system-level boundaries related to performance and external dependencies that must be validated.

#### System Performance Boundary Testing

**Evidence**: The `creditcheckservice.CreditScore.httpConnResource` defines the HTTP connector, but no explicit performance constraints are defined. The JDBC activities in `LookupDatabase.bwp` have a `timeout="10"` attribute.

**Impact**: Under high load, the service may become unresponsive, leading to a poor user experience and cascading failures in upstream systems. A slow database query could cause all threads to block, leading to a service outage.

**Recommendation**: Execute performance and stress tests to identify system limits.

| Test Case Description | Scenario | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Concurrent User Boundary | Simulate 1, 10, 50, and 100 concurrent users making requests to the `/creditscore` endpoint. | The service maintains an average response time below a defined SLA (e.g., 500ms) and does not produce errors. |
| Response Time Boundary | Induce a database delay of >10 seconds for the `JDBCQuery` activity. | The TIBCO process should time out gracefully and return a proper error (e.g., 504 Gateway Timeout) rather than hanging indefinitely. |
| Load Spike Testing | Send a sudden burst of 200 requests after a period of inactivity. | The system should handle the spike without crashing, though response times may temporarily increase. It should recover to normal performance levels quickly. |

### Integration Boundary Testing

The primary integration point is the PostgreSQL database. Its configuration and usage patterns present several boundaries.

#### Database Integration Boundary Test Cases

**Evidence**: The `JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` file specifies a connection to a PostgreSQL database. The `LookupDatabase.bwp` process uses a `maxRows="100"` setting for its query.

**Impact**: An improperly bounded query could return more data than the application expects, leading to incorrect logic execution (as it only processes `Record[1]`). Connection pool exhaustion can render the service completely unavailable.

**Recommendation**: Test the boundaries of the database integration.

| Test Case Description | Scenario | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `maxRows` Boundary | Provide an `SSN` input like `'123%'` that matches more than 100 records in the database. | The `JDBCQuery` activity should return only 100 records. The application logic should proceed based on the first record, and this behavior should be documented as a potential business logic flaw. |
| Connection Pool Exhaustion | Using a load testing tool, open more concurrent connections than the pool allows. | New requests should fail gracefully with a clear error message indicating a connection could not be obtained, rather than timing out or crashing. |
| No Record Found | Send a request with an `SSN` that does not exist in the database. | The process logic correctly identifies that no record was found and throws the `DefaultFault`, resulting in a 404 Not Found response as per the API definition. |

## Evidence Summary

*   **Scope Analyzed**: The analysis focused on the TIBCO BusinessWorks project `CreditCheckService`, including its process definitions (`.bwp`), configuration files (`.substvar`, `.jdbcResource`, `.httpConnResource`), and service descriptors (`.json`).
*   **Key Data Points**:
    *   **API Endpoint**: `POST /creditscore`
    *   **Database Query**: `select * from public.creditscore where ssn like ?`
    *   **Database Update**: `UPDATE creditscore SET numofpulls = ? WHERE ssn like ?`
    *   **JDBC Timeout**: 10 seconds
    *   **JDBC Max Rows**: 100
*   **References**:
    *   `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/LookupDatabase.bwp` (for SQL logic, timeout, maxRows)
    *   `CreditCheckService/Service Descriptors/creditcheckservice.Process-CreditScore.json` (for API contract)
    *   `CreditCheckService/Resources/creditcheckservice/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` (for DB driver and connection details)

## Assumptions Made

*   The valid business range for a `ficoscore` is assumed to be 300-850, based on industry standards.
*   The `ssn` field is intended to find a unique record, and the use of `LIKE` is a potential implementation flaw rather than an intentional feature to support wildcard searches.
*   The `rating` field being empty or null is the correct condition for determining that a record was not found.
*   The application is intended to be stateless, as is common for REST services.

## Open Questions

*   What is the expected string format for the `SSN` and `DOB` fields in the API request?
*   What is the business requirement if the `ssn like ?` query returns multiple matching records? The current implementation only processes the first one, which is likely incorrect.
*   Is there a maximum value or business rule associated with the `numofpulls` field? What should happen upon reaching this limit or in case of an integer overflow?
*   What are the defined performance SLAs for the `/creditscore` endpoint (e.g., P99 response time, requests per second)?

## Confidence Level

**Overall Confidence**: High

**Rationale**: The codebase, though based on a proprietary platform (TIBCO), uses standard components like REST, JDBC, and SQL, whose boundaries are well-understood. The XML-based process and configuration files are verbose and clearly define key boundary parameters like timeouts, SQL statements, and `maxRows`. The simplicity of the application's logic (one primary endpoint, two DB interactions) allows for a confident and thorough identification of its critical boundaries.

## Action Items

**Immediate** (Next Sprint):
*   [ ] **Implement Negative Path API Tests**: Create and automate tests that send invalid, empty, and malicious string inputs (especially for the `SSN` field) to the `/creditscore` endpoint to ensure the API fails securely.
*   [ ] **Clarify Multi-Record SSN Logic**: Escalate the open question regarding the `ssn like ?` clause to the business/development team. The current implementation is a high-risk data integrity issue.

**Short-term** (Next 1-2 Sprints):
*   [ ] **Implement Numeric Boundary Tests**: Add automated tests for the `ficoscore` and `numofpulls` fields, including values at, below, and above expected ranges, and test for integer overflow.
*   [ ] **Develop Basic Performance Test Suite**: Create a load test script (e.g., using JMeter, Gatling) to establish a performance baseline and test the concurrent user boundary.

**Long-term** (Next Quarter):
*   [ ] **Integrate Boundary Tests into CI/CD**: Ensure all recommended boundary tests are fully automated and run as part of the standard CI/CD pipeline to prevent regressions.
*   [ ] **Implement Chaos Testing for Dependencies**: Introduce tests that simulate database timeouts and connection failures to validate the system's resilience.

## Risk Assessment

*   **High Risk**:
    *   **Data Integrity Failure**: The use of `ssn like ?` with logic that only processes the first returned record can lead to updating the wrong customer's `numofpulls` or returning the wrong credit score.
    *   **Performance Degradation/DoS**: A malicious or accidental `SSN` input of `'%'` could trigger a full table scan on the database, potentially causing a service outage.
*   **Medium Risk**:
    *   **Integer Overflow**: The `numofpulls` field could overflow if not handled, leading to data corruption or runtime errors.
    *   **Unhandled System Timeouts**: A slow database query lasting over 10 seconds could cause cascading failures if not handled gracefully by the TIBCO process and upstream clients.
*   **Low Risk**:
    *   **Invalid Data Storage**: Lack of strict validation on `FirstName`, `LastName`, or `DOB` could lead to poorly formatted data in the database, but is unlikely to cause system failure.
