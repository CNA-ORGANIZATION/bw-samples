## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive set of MFDA (Mainframe and Distributed Application) test cases for the `CreditCheckService` application. The analysis of the TIBCO BusinessWorks project reveals two primary integration points relevant to the MFDA scope: a REST API (classified as Apigee/Web Services) and a JDBC connection to a PostgreSQL database (classified as AlloyDB). No evidence of MFT, Kafka, or Oracle integrations was found.

The generated test cases cover Integration, Regression, and End-to-End scenarios, focusing on validating the core business logic: receiving a credit check request via API, looking up data in the database, updating an inquiry counter, and returning the result. The test cases are structured to validate functionality, error handling, data integrity, and performance, providing a clear roadmap for QE activities.

## Evidence Summary
- **Scope Analyzed**: The analysis covered all files in the `CreditCheckService` TIBCO project, including the parent application wrapper.
- **Key Data Points**:
    - **1** primary business process identified (`creditcheckservice.Process`).
    - **1** subprocess identified (`creditcheckservice.LookupDatabase`).
    - **1** REST API endpoint exposed (`POST /creditscore`).
    - **1** JDBC database connection configured (PostgreSQL).
    - **2** database operations performed (`SELECT` and `UPDATE`).
- **References**:
    - `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/Process.bwp`: Defines the main workflow, API trigger, and error handling.
    - `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/LookupDatabase.bwp`: Contains the core database query and update logic.
    - `CreditCheckService/Resources/creditcheckservice/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource`: Defines the PostgreSQL database connection.
    - `CreditCheckService/META-INF/module.bwm`: Defines the REST service binding.
    - `CreditCheckService/Service Descriptors/creditcheckservice.Process-CreditScore.json`: Defines the Swagger/OpenAPI contract for the service.

## Assumptions Made
- The PostgreSQL database connection (`BWCE.DB.URL`) is the designated **AlloyDB** integration point for MFDA purposes.
- The REST service exposed via `CreditScore.httpConnResource` is the designated **Apigee/Web Services** integration point.
- The business purpose of the service is to perform a credit check, retrieve a score, and log the inquiry by incrementing a counter (`numofpulls`).
- The `creditscore` table exists in the `public` schema of the target database with columns matching the `JDBC Query` activity (`firstname`, `lastname`, `ssn`, `dateofBirth`, `ficoscore`, `rating`, `numofpulls`).
- The application is intended to be deployed in a containerized environment, as suggested by `docker.substvar`.

## Open Questions
- What are the specific performance SLAs for the `/creditscore` API endpoint (e.g., p95 response time, requests per second)?
- Are there any security requirements for the API, such as API Key validation, that are handled by an upstream gateway (like Apigee) and are not visible in the TIBCO code?
- What are the exact data validation rules for the input `SSN` field?
- What is the expected behavior if the database connection defined in `JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` fails? The `catchAll` block suggests a generic 404 is returned, which may not be the desired business outcome.

## Confidence Level
**Overall Confidence**: High

**Rationale**:
The provided TIBCO BusinessWorks project files (`.bwp`, `.jdbcResource`, `.bwm`) are highly descriptive and provide a clear, visual representation of the application's logic. The data flow, database queries, and error handling paths are explicitly defined, leaving little room for ambiguity in the core functionality. The analysis is based on concrete evidence within these XML-based process definitions.

**Evidence**:
- **File references with line numbers where patterns were found**: The logic is defined visually in `.bwp` files, but the XML structure confirms the activities. For example, in `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/LookupDatabase.bwp`, the SQL statement `select * from public.creditscore where ssn like ?` is explicitly defined within the `jdbcPalette:JDBCQueryActivity` element.
- **Configuration files that informed decisions**: `CreditCheckService/Resources/creditcheckservice/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` clearly specifies the `org.postgresql.Driver` and a JDBC URL structure for PostgreSQL. `CreditCheckService/META-INF/default.substvar` provides default values for these connections.
- **Code examples that demonstrate current implementation**: The XSLT transformations within the `.bwp` files show exactly how data is mapped between activities, such as the mapping of the incoming SSN to the `LookupDatabase` subprocess input.

## Action Items
**Immediate** (This Sprint):
- [ ] Execute the `High` priority Integration and E2E test cases manually to establish a quality baseline.
- [ ] Begin automation of the `High` priority test cases (MFDA-INT-API-001, MFDA-INT-ADB-001, MFDA-E2E-API-001).

**Short-term** (Next 1-2 Sprints):
- [ ] Automate all remaining generated test cases.
- [ ] Develop performance test scripts based on the E2E scenario to measure baseline performance.
- [ ] Clarify the open questions with the development and business teams to create more targeted negative and security test cases.

**Long-term** (Next Quarter):
- [ ] Integrate the full automated test suite into a CI/CD pipeline for continuous regression testing.
- [ ] Expand test data to cover more diverse edge cases for data formats and boundary conditions.

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: **Data Integrity Failure**. If the `UPDATE` operation fails after a successful `SELECT`, the inquiry count (`numofpulls`) could become inconsistent. The current process does not appear to wrap the select and update in a single transaction, posing a risk.
- **Medium Risk**: **Incorrect Error Handling**. A database failure or a non-existent record both result in a generic 404 error to the client. This masks the true nature of the problem, complicating client-side error handling and support diagnostics.
- **Low Risk**: **Performance Bottleneck**. The `select *` query in `LookupDatabase.bwp` could cause performance issues if the `creditscore` table grows very large or contains large LOB-style columns. The query should be modified to select only the required columns.
