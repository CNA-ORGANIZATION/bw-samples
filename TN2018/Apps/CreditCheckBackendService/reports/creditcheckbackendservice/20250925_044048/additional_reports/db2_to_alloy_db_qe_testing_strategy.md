## Executive Summary

The analysis of the provided codebase reveals that a DB2 to AlloyDB QE testing strategy is not applicable. The application, `CreditCheckService`, is built on TIBCO BusinessWorks and is already configured to use a PostgreSQL database, which is compatible with AlloyDB. No DB2 drivers, connection strings, or specific SQL syntax were found in any of the configuration or process files.

## Analysis

### No DB2 Dependencies Detected

**Evidence**:
- **JDBC Driver**: The primary JDBC resource configuration explicitly specifies the PostgreSQL driver.
  - **File**: `CreditCheckService/Resources/creditcheckservice/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource`
  - **Content**: `jdbcDriver="org.postgresql.Driver"`
- **Database URL**: All database connection URLs found in the configuration files use the PostgreSQL JDBC format (`jdbc:postgresql://`).
  - **File**: `CreditCheckService/META-INF/default.substvar`
  - **Content**: `<name>BWCE.DB.URL</name><value>jdbc:postgresql://abc:5432/bookstore</value>`
  - **File**: `CreditCheckService/Resources/creditcheckservice/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource`
  - **Content**: `dbURL="BWCE.DB.URL jdbc:postgresql://awagle:5432/bookstore"`
- **SQL Syntax**: The SQL queries within the TIBCO processes are standard and do not use any DB2-specific functions or syntax.
  - **File**: `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/LookupDatabase.bwp`
  - **Content**: `sqlStatement="select * from public.creditscore where ssn like ?"` and `sqlStatement="UPDATE creditscore SET numofpulls = ? WHERE ssn like ?"`

**Impact**:
- A migration from DB2 to AlloyDB is not required for this application, as it is already using a PostgreSQL-compatible database.
- The requested QE testing strategy for a DB2 migration is therefore unnecessary.

**Recommendation**:
- No action is required regarding a DB2 to AlloyDB migration for this codebase. The focus should be on standard QE testing for the existing PostgreSQL integration.

## Evidence Summary

- **Scope Analyzed**: The analysis covered all TIBCO project files, including application configurations (`.substvar`), module definitions (`.bwm`), process definitions (`.bwp`), and resource configurations (`.jdbcResource`).
- **Key Data Points**:
  - 0 instances of DB2 drivers (`com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver`).
  - 0 instances of DB2 connection URL formats (`jdbc:db2://`).
  - 4 instances of PostgreSQL drivers or connection URLs were identified across the project.
- **References**: The conclusion is based on consistent findings in `JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource`, `default.substvar`, and `docker.substvar` files.

## Assumptions Made

- It is assumed that the provided files represent the complete and current state of the application's database configuration.

## Open Questions

- None. The evidence is conclusive that the application does not use DB2.

## Confidence Level

**Overall Confidence**: High

**Rationale**: The database driver and connection URLs are explicitly and consistently defined as PostgreSQL across all relevant configuration files within the TIBCO project structure. There is no conflicting evidence suggesting any DB2 usage.

## Action Items

- **Immediate**:
  - [ ] Confirm with the project team that no other hidden or environment-specific DB2 connections exist outside of the provided codebase.
- **Short-term**:
  - [ ] Archive the request for a DB2 migration testing strategy for this application as "Not Applicable".

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None.
- **Medium Risk**: None.
- **Low Risk**: There is a minimal risk that environment-specific overrides not present in the codebase could point to a DB2 instance, but this is highly unlikely given the PostgreSQL driver is hardcoded in the `.jdbcResource` file.
