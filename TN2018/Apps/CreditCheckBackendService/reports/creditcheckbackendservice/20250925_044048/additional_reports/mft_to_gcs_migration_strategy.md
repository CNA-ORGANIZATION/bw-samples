An MFT to GCS migration strategy is not applicable for this repository.

The analysis of the codebase did not identify any use of traditional Managed File Transfer (MFT) technologies, including FTP, SFTP, or specific mainframe MFT indicators such as `ZMFT101P`, `ZMFT104P`, `ZMFTPSP`, or `zos`.

The application is a TIBCO BusinessWorks (BW) service that exposes a REST API for credit checking and interacts with a PostgreSQL database. It does not contain any logic related to file-based transfers that would necessitate a migration to Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

Therefore, the requested report is **Not Applicable**.
