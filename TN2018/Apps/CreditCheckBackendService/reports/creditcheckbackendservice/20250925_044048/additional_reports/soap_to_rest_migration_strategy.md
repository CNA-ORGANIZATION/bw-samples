Not Applicable - No SOAP endpoints detected, no migration strategy required.

### Evidence Summary
- **Analysis Scope**: The entire codebase, including TIBCO BusinessWorks (BW) process files (`.bwp`), module configurations (`.bwm`), and service descriptors, was analyzed for SOAP-based service implementations.
- **Key Findings**:
  - The primary service interface is defined in `CreditCheckService\META-INF\module.bwm`.
  - While this file references a WSDL for the interface definition (`<sca:interface.wsdl ...>`), the actual service binding is explicitly configured as REST: `<scaext:binding xsi:type="rest:RestServiceBinding" ... path="/creditscore">`.
  - The service descriptors (`creditcheckservice.Process-CreditScore.json` and `GetCreditStoreBackend_0.1.json`) are Swagger 2.0 (OpenAPI) files, which are used for defining REST APIs, not SOAP services.
  - There are no SOAP bindings (`<soap:binding>`), SOAP envelopes, or `javax.xml.ws` dependencies that would indicate the presence of SOAP services.
- **Conclusion**: The application already exposes its services via RESTful endpoints. The use of WSDL files is an internal implementation detail of the TIBCO BW platform for defining process contracts, but the external-facing protocol is REST. Therefore, a SOAP to REST migration is not applicable.
