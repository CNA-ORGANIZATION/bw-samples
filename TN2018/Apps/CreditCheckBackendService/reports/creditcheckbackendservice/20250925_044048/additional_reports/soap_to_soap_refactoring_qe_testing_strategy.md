Not Applicable - No SOAP endpoints requiring refactoring were detected.

### Analysis Summary

A thorough analysis of the provided `CreditCheckService` TIBCO BusinessWorks (BW) project was conducted to identify SOAP services for a security refactoring effort. The analysis revealed that the application does not expose any SOAP endpoints. Instead, it exposes a REST API.

### Evidence

1.  **Module Binding Configuration (`CreditCheckService\META-INF\module.bwm`):**
    *   The primary service binding is explicitly defined as `rest:RestServiceBinding`. There are no `soap:SoapBinding` definitions present in the module configuration.
    ```xml
    <scaext:binding xsi:type="rest:RestServiceBinding" xmi:id="_5nCQUK1sEeinzqZPu0o7yw" name="RestService" path="/creditscore" ...>
    ```

2.  **Service Descriptor Files:**
    *   The service contracts are defined using Swagger/OpenAPI JSON files (`creditcheckservice.Process-CreditScore.json` and `GetCreditStoreBackend_0.1.json`), which are standard for REST APIs, not WSDL files typically used for SOAP services.

3.  **Process Definition (`CreditCheckService\Processes\creditcheckservice\Process.bwp`):**
    *   The WSDL portType definition for the `creditscore` service includes the attribute `tibex:source="bw.rest.service"`, confirming that the underlying implementation is a REST service.

### Conclusion

The `CreditCheckService` application is built as a RESTful service. Since no SOAP services with mTLS or no authentication were found, the requested "SOAP to SOAP Refactoring QE Testing Strategy" is not applicable to this codebase.
