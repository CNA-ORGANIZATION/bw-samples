## Executive Summary

This analysis catalogs the features of the `CreditCheckService` application. Based on a review of the TIBCO BusinessWorks processes, service descriptors, and database configurations, the system is a specialized microservice designed for a single core purpose: to provide real-time credit score information. It retrieves a person's credit profile from a database using their Social Security Number (SSN), tracks the inquiry, and returns the credit score and rating. The primary features support automated, data-driven decision-making for financial risk assessment.

## Feature Catalog

### Feature Categories

The application's features fall into two main business categories:

*   **Risk & Compliance Features**: Capabilities that protect the business by assessing credit risk and maintaining an audit trail of credit inquiries, which is essential for regulatory compliance.
*   **Operational Efficiency Features**: Capabilities that automate and accelerate business processes, such as loan approvals or customer onboarding, by providing instant access to critical data.

### Feature Catalog Table

| Feature Name | Business Value | Who Benefits | What It Does | Business Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Real-time Credit Score Retrieval** | Enables immediate, data-driven financial decisions by providing instant access to credit profiles. | Underwriters, Loan Officers, Automated Lending Systems | Accepts a person's Social Security Number (SSN) and returns their FICO score, credit rating, and the number of recent inquiries. | Accelerates loan application processing, reduces manual underwriting effort, and ensures consistent risk assessment. |
| **Credit Inquiry Tracking** | Provides a complete audit trail of credit checks and helps assess borrower risk more accurately. | Risk Management, Compliance Officers | Automatically logs every credit score request by incrementing an inquiry counter in the individual's credit profile. | Improves risk assessment accuracy by flagging excessive credit-seeking behavior and supports compliance with credit reporting laws (e.g., FCRA). |
| **Invalid Applicant Handling** | Prevents process delays by providing immediate, clear feedback for requests that cannot be fulfilled. | Requesting Systems, Operations Staff | If a credit check is requested for an SSN not found in the database, the system returns a "Not Found" status instead of failing silently. | Improves system reliability and allows for automated exception handling, such as triggering a manual identity verification process. |

### Feature Descriptions

#### Feature: Real-time Credit Score Retrieval

*   **Business Purpose**: This feature is the core function of the application. It solves the business problem of needing immediate, accurate credit information to make financial decisions about a customer. It provides the data necessary for processes like loan origination, credit limit adjustments, and identity verification. The primary value is speed and automation, replacing a potentially slow, manual credit check process.
*   **Capabilities**:
    *   **Submit Credit Check Request**: A user or system can submit a request containing an individual's personal information, with the Social Security Number (SSN) being the key identifier.
    *   **Receive Instant Credit Profile**: The system retrieves and returns a concise credit profile, including the FICO score, a qualitative rating (e.g., "Excellent"), and the total number of credit inquiries on file.
*   **Business Impact**:
    *   **Revenue Impact**: Directly enables revenue-generating activities like lending by providing the necessary risk data to approve applications.
    *   **Efficiency Impact**: Drastically reduces the time required to process credit-dependent applications, allowing the business to serve more customers faster.
    *   **Risk Impact**: Standardizes credit risk assessment, reducing the chance of human error and ensuring decisions are based on consistent data.
*   **Evidence**:
    *   The REST service is defined in `CreditCheckService/Service Descriptors/creditcheckservice.Process-CreditScore.json`, which exposes a `POST /creditscore` endpoint.
    *   The main workflow in `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/Process.bwp` orchestrates the process of receiving a request and calling the `LookupDatabase` sub-process.
    *   The `LookupDatabase.bwp` process executes the SQL query `select * from public.creditscore where ssn like ?` to retrieve the data.
    *   The response data contract is defined in `CreditCheckService/Schemas/GetCreditStoreBackend_0.1.xsd`, specifying the `FICOScore`, `Rating`, and `NoOfInquiries` fields.

## Evidence Summary

*   **Scope Analyzed**: The analysis covered the entire `CreditCheckService` TIBCO project, including all BusinessWorks processes (`.bwp`), service descriptors (`.json`), schemas (`.xsd`), and configuration files (`.substvar`, `.jdbcResource`).
*   **Key Data Points**:
    *   **1** primary business service exposed (`/creditscore`).
    *   **2** core business processes identified (`Process.bwp`, `LookupDatabase.bwp`).
    *   **1** database integration (`creditcheckservice.JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource`) to a PostgreSQL database.
    *   **7** key business data fields are managed: `firstname`, `lastname`, `ssn`, `dateofBirth`, `ficoscore`, `rating`, `numofpulls`.
*   **References**: Findings are based on the explicit definitions within the TIBCO project files, particularly the REST service contracts and the SQL queries embedded in the business processes.

## Assumptions Made

*   **User Persona**: It is assumed that the "user" of this service is not an end-consumer but rather an internal employee (e.g., an underwriter) or another automated system within the company's ecosystem that needs to perform credit checks.
*   **Data Source**: The PostgreSQL database connected via `JDBCConnectionResource` is assumed to be the single, authoritative source of truth for customer credit scores managed by this application.
*   **Business Context**: The application's name and functionality strongly imply it operates within the financial services, lending, or banking domain.

## Open Questions

*   **Data Provenance**: How is the `creditscore` table in the PostgreSQL database populated and kept up-to-date? Is there an upstream data feed from a credit bureau (e.g., Experian, Equifax)?
*   **Service Consumers**: Which specific applications or business units are the intended consumers of this credit check service?
*   **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**: What are the business expectations for this service's uptime and response time? The technical configurations do not specify this.
*   **Compliance Scope**: What specific regulations (e.g., FCRA, GDPR) does this service need to comply with? The code does not contain explicit compliance checks.

## Confidence Level

*   **Overall Confidence**: High
*   **Rationale**: The project is small, self-contained, and its purpose is exceptionally clear from the naming conventions (`CreditCheckService`, `creditscore` table, `FICOScore` field) and the simple, direct business logic. The API contracts and process flows are unambiguous, leaving little room for misinterpretation of the core features.

## Action Items

As a Product Manager, the focus is on documenting existing capabilities. No implementation action items are relevant. The next steps would be to validate the findings in the "Open Questions" section with business stakeholders to build a complete product profile.

## Risk Assessment

This persona is focused on feature documentation, not risk assessment. No business risks are identified as part of this analysis.
