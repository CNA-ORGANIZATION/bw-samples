An analysis of the codebase was conducted to identify and document the business-level non-functional requirements and service expectations for the `CreditCheckService` application. The focus of this report is to translate technical configurations and implementation details into their real-world business implications, particularly concerning system performance, availability, and quality of service.

## Executive Summary

The `CreditCheckService` application is designed to provide credit score information based on a Social Security Number (SSN). The system's non-functional requirements, as derived from the code, center on two critical business expectations: **responsiveness** and **reliability**. Technical configurations reveal a maximum wait time of 10 seconds for database lookups, which directly translates to a service level expectation for any business process using this service. The system is critically dependent on a backend PostgreSQL database, making database availability the primary factor for the service's own uptime.

## Business Service Level Table

The following table outlines the key business processes, customer expectations, and the business impact of failing to meet these service levels, based on evidence from the codebase.

| Business Process | Customer Expectation | Current Capability | Business Impact if Not Met | Monthly Value at Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Real-time Credit Score Lookup** | Receive a credit score and rating in near real-time to support immediate decisions (e.g., loan approvals, identity verification). | The system will wait a maximum of 10 seconds for a database response before failing the request. | Delays or failures in credit checks can halt customer onboarding, loan origination, or risk assessment processes, leading to lost sales opportunities and customer frustration. | High (Dependent on transaction volume; delays could jeopardize millions in potential loans or sales). |
| **Data Integrity and Audit** | Ensure that every credit check is accurately recorded and that the data returned is from a reliable source. | The system logs the success or failure of each invocation and updates a "number of pulls" counter in the database. | Inaccurate data or failed audit trails could lead to incorrect credit decisions, regulatory compliance failures (e.g., under FCRA), and financial risk. | Medium (Primarily compliance and operational risk). |
| **System Availability** | The service must be available during critical business hours when customer-facing applications require credit checks. | The service is critically dependent on the availability of its backend PostgreSQL database. | If the service is unavailable, all dependent business processes (e.g., new account opening, credit line increases) will be blocked, directly impacting revenue and operations. | High (Directly proportional to the value of transactions blocked by the outage). |

## Critical Business Service Levels

### Customer Experience Requirements

*   **Responsiveness:** Business processes that consume this service, such as online loan applications, have an implicit expectation of a quick response.
    *   **Evidence**: The `LookupDatabase.bwp` process configures a `timeout="10"` for both the `JDBCQuery` and `JDBCUpdate` activities.
    *   **Business Requirement**: **Credit check results must be returned within 10 seconds.** Any longer duration is considered a failure. This service level agreement (SLA) is critical for customer-facing applications where user abandonment rates increase significantly with response times over a few seconds. Failure to meet this SLA could directly result in lost customers during an application process.

### Operational Efficiency Requirements

*   **Process Reliability:** The system is designed to provide a definitive outcome for every request, preventing dependent business processes from getting stuck in an unknown state.
    *   **Evidence**: The main process `Process.bwp` includes a `catchAll` fault handler. If the database lookup fails (e.g., times out or the SSN is not found), the process throws a fault, which is caught and results in a `404 Not Found` error being returned to the client.
    *   **Business Requirement**: **Every credit check request must result in a clear success or failure response.** This ensures that automated downstream systems, like loan underwriting platforms, can proceed with a defined workflow (e.g., "approve," "deny," or "manual review") without manual intervention, thus maintaining operational efficiency.

### Compliance & Risk Requirements

*   **Data Handling and Security:** The service handles Personally Identifiable Information (PII), specifically Social Security Numbers (SSNs), which implies strict security and compliance requirements.
    *   **Evidence**: The `LookupDatabase.bwp` process uses `ssn` as the primary key for database lookups. The `JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` file contains an encrypted password (`#!yk2zPUfipGX2vB+1XNJha9KX6eLVDmcZ`) for database access.
    *   **Business Requirement**: **All sensitive data, including SSNs and database credentials, must be handled securely.** This is not just a technical requirement but a business mandate to comply with data privacy regulations (like GDPR, CCPA) and avoid significant financial penalties and reputational damage associated with data breaches.

## Business Availability Requirements

The availability of the Credit Check Service is directly tied to its dependencies.

| Business Hours | Critical Processes | Acceptable Downtime | Business Impact per Hour Down |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 24/7 (Assumed for digital applications) | Real-time Credit Score Lookup | Dependent on backend database SLA | High. Halts all new customer credit-based onboarding and loan origination. Financial impact is the total value of lost business opportunities during the outage. |

*   **Evidence**: The `JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` file defines a mandatory connection to a PostgreSQL database. The entire functionality of the service relies on this connection being active.
*   **Business Requirement**: **The service's availability is critically dependent on the backend PostgreSQL database.** Business continuity and disaster recovery plans for this service must prioritize the availability and recovery of this specific database.

## Performance Impact on Business

The system's performance directly impacts the success of the business processes it supports.

| User Action | Expected Experience | Business Benefit | If Too Slow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Submit an application requiring a credit check. | The credit check portion of the application completes in under 10 seconds. | High conversion rates on new customer applications; smooth and efficient automated underwriting. | The process fails, potentially causing the user to abandon their application. This leads to lost revenue and a poor customer experience. |

*   **Evidence**: The 10-second timeout in `LookupDatabase.bwp` is the clearest performance indicator.
*   **Business Requirement**: The end-to-end business process must account for this 10-second maximum latency. If other steps in the process take 5 seconds, the user-facing application must be designed with the expectation that the total time could be up to 15 seconds. This SLA is a key input for designing user experiences and managing customer expectations.

## Evidence Summary

*   **Scope Analyzed**: The analysis covered all TIBCO BusinessWorks project files, including process definitions (`.bwp`), configuration files (`.substvar`, `.httpConnResource`, `.jdbcResource`), and service descriptors (`.json`, `.xsd`).
*   **Key Data Points**:
    *   A hard-coded **10-second timeout** was identified for all JDBC (database) activities in `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/LookupDatabase.bwp`.
    *   A critical dependency on a **PostgreSQL database** was confirmed in `CreditCheckService/Resources/creditcheckservice/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource`.
    *   The service handles **SSN** as a primary input, confirmed in `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/Process.bwp` and schema files.
    *   The system returns a **404 Not Found** on failure, as defined in the fault handler in `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/Process.bwp`.

## Assumptions Made

*   It is assumed that the `CreditCheckService` is a critical component in real-time, customer-facing workflows, such as online loan applications or new account openings, where responsiveness is key to conversion.
*   It is assumed that the 10-second timeout is a deliberate business SLA and not an arbitrary developer default.
*   The business operates in a jurisdiction with strict PII and data privacy regulations (e.g., United States, Europe), making the handling of SSNs a high-risk activity.

## Open Questions

*   Is the 10-second timeout for database queries aligned with the business's actual SLA for customer-facing applications? What is the business impact if this timeout is frequently reached?
*   What are the official availability and recovery time objectives (RTO/RPO) for the backend PostgreSQL database? The service's availability is directly dependent on this.
*   What is the expected transaction volume (credit checks per minute/hour) for this service? This is needed to assess if the current architecture can meet performance and scalability needs.
*   What are the compliance standards (e.g., PCI, FCRA, GDPR) that this service must adhere to, given it processes sensitive PII like SSNs?

## Confidence Level

**Overall Confidence**: High

**Rationale**: The evidence for the core non-functional requirements is explicit in the TIBCO configuration files. Timeouts, database dependencies, and error handling paths are clearly defined in the `.bwp` and resource files. While the exact business impact requires some domain-based inference, the technical configurations provide a strong and factual foundation for the derived business requirements.

**Evidence**:
*   **Timeout Requirement**: `timeout="10"` attribute on `jdbcQueryActivity` and `jdbcUpdateActivity` in `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/LookupDatabase.bwp`.
*   **Database Dependency**: `jdbcDriver="org.postgresql.Driver"` and `dbURL` property in `CreditCheckService/Resources/creditcheckservice/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource`.
*   **Reliability/Error Handling**: The `catchAll` fault handler in `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/Process.bwp` which leads to a `404` reply.

## Action Items

**Immediate** (This Sprint):
*   [ ] **Validate SLA**: Business stakeholders should formally confirm if the 10-second response time SLA is acceptable for all consuming applications.
*   [ ] **Confirm Database Tier**: Operations and business teams must confirm the availability tier and disaster recovery plan for the backend PostgreSQL database, as it is a single point of failure for this service.

**Short-term** (Next 1-2 Sprints):
*   [ ] **Document Dependencies**: Formally document the critical dependency on the PostgreSQL database in all business continuity and service management documentation.
*   [ ] **Review Compliance**: Conduct a compliance review to ensure the current implementation for handling SSNs meets all regulatory requirements.

**Long-term** (Next Quarter):
*   [ ] **Implement Monitoring**: Implement business-level monitoring to track the average response time of the credit check service and alert stakeholders if it approaches the 10-second limit.

## Risk Assessment

*   **High Risk**: **Service Unavailability due to Database Dependency**. A failure in the backend PostgreSQL database will cause a complete outage of the credit check service, halting all dependent business processes.
*   **Medium Risk**: **Poor Customer Experience due to Latency**. If the database performance degrades and requests regularly take close to 10 seconds, user-facing applications will feel slow, leading to high cart/application abandonment rates.
*   **Low Risk**: **Inconsistent Error Handling**. While the primary failure path is handled, other unhandled exceptions could lead to uninformative `500` errors, confusing consuming systems.
