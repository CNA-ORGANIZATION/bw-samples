## Executive Summary

This analysis documents the business rules and workflows for the **Credit Check Service**. The system's core function is to provide a customer's credit score and rating upon request. It operates under strict policies to ensure data completeness and to maintain an audit trail of all credit inquiries. Key workflows include retrieving a customer's credit profile from a central database, validating that the profile is complete, incrementing an inquiry counter, and returning the credit information. If a customer's profile is found but is incomplete, the system is designed to treat the request as if the customer was not found, ensuring that business decisions are not made based on insufficient data.

## Analysis

### Business Rules Catalog

The following table outlines the key business policies and governance rules that are embedded within the Credit Check Service's logic. These rules govern data integrity, compliance, and error handling.

| Rule Name | Business Purpose | Policy Statement | Business Impact if Violated | Owner Department |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Credit Profile Completeness Check** | To prevent business decisions based on incomplete data. | A credit check request can only be considered successful if a valid credit rating is found in the customer's profile. | Decisions made on incomplete data could lead to inaccurate risk assessment, resulting in financial losses or missed opportunities. | Risk Management / Underwriting |
| **Credit Inquiry Tracking** | To maintain a compliant audit trail of all credit checks and to monitor a customer's credit-seeking activity. | Every time a customer's credit score is successfully retrieved, the system must increment the official count of inquiries for that customer's record by one. | Failure to track inquiries could lead to non-compliance with regulations (e.g., FCRA) and an inability to accurately assess a customer's risk profile. | Compliance / Legal |
| **Incomplete Profile Rejection** | To enforce data quality standards and trigger a manual review process for profiles with missing information. | If a customer's credit profile is retrieved but is missing a rating, the automated process must be stopped and treated as a failure. | Allowing processes to continue with incomplete data would bypass data quality controls and could lead to significant financial risk. | Data Governance / Operations |
| **Obfuscate Internal Failures** | To simplify the experience for systems using this service and to prevent exposing internal system state. | All internal processing failures, including the rejection of an incomplete profile, must be reported to the calling system as a simple "Not Found" error. | While this simplifies integration, it may hide critical data quality issues from front-line systems, potentially delaying data correction. | IT / Product Management |

### Workflow Documentation

The primary business process supported by this system is the "Customer Credit Score Inquiry" workflow.

**Workflow Name**: Customer Credit Score Inquiry

**Business Purpose**:
This workflow provides an automated, real-time method for internal business systems (e.g., loan origination, customer onboarding) to retrieve a customer's credit score. Its purpose is to facilitate rapid, data-driven decisions while ensuring that a compliant audit trail of all credit inquiries is maintained.

**Process Steps**:

1.  **Initiate Credit Check**
    *   **Who**: An authorized internal system or application.
    *   **What**: The system requests a credit check for a specific customer. The request must include the customer's Social Security Number (SSN) to uniquely identify them.
    *   **Why**: To begin the process of assessing a customer's creditworthiness for a business transaction.
    *   **When**: Triggered when a business process, such as a loan application, requires a credit assessment.
    *   **Evidence**: The process is initiated by a `POST` request to the `/creditscore` REST endpoint, as defined in `CreditCheckService/Service Descriptors/creditcheckservice.Process-CreditScore.json`.

2.  **Retrieve Credit Profile**
    *   **Who**: The Credit Check Service.
    *   **What**: The system uses the provided SSN to query the central `creditscore` database and retrieve the customer's full credit profile.
    *   **Why**: To access the raw data needed to fulfill the credit check request.
    *   **When**: Immediately after a valid request is received.
    *   **Evidence**: The `QueryRecords` activity in `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/LookupDatabase.bwp` executes the query `select * from public.creditscore where ssn like ?`.

3.  **Validate Profile Completeness (Business Rule Check)**
    *   **Who**: The Credit Check Service.
    *   **What**: The system inspects the retrieved credit profile to ensure it contains a credit `rating`.
    *   **Why**: To enforce the "Credit Profile Completeness Check" policy, ensuring no decisions are made on partial data.
    *   **When**: After the database lookup is complete.
    *_   **Evidence**: A conditional link in `LookupDatabase.bwp` checks `string-length($QueryRecords/Record[1]/rating)>0`.

4.  **Handle Incomplete Profile (Exception Path)**
    *   **Who**: The Credit Check Service.
    *   **What**: If the profile has no rating, the workflow is immediately terminated. The system sends a "Not Found" (404) error back to the requesting application.
    *   **Why**: To enforce the "Incomplete Profile Rejection" and "Obfuscate Internal Failures" policies, preventing further processing and signaling a data issue.
    *   **When**: This path is taken if the completeness check in the previous step fails.
    *   **Evidence**: The `Throw` activity in `LookupDatabase.bwp` is triggered, which is caught by the `catchAll` handler in `Process.bwp`, leading to a `404` reply.

5.  **Update Inquiry Count (Happy Path)**
    *   **Who**: The Credit Check Service.
    *   **What**: The system increments the `numofpulls` (number of inquiries) field on the customer's record in the database by one.
    *   **Why**: To enforce the "Credit Inquiry Tracking" policy for audit and compliance purposes.
    *   **When**: After the profile has been validated as complete and before the final response is sent.
    *   **Evidence**: The `UpdatePulls` activity in `LookupDatabase.bwp` executes `UPDATE creditscore SET numofpulls = ? WHERE ssn like ?`, with the new value calculated as `numofpulls + 1`.

6.  **Return Credit Information (Happy Path)**
    *   **Who**: The Credit Check Service.
    *   **What**: The system packages the key credit information (`FICOScore`, `Rating`, `NoOfInquiries`) and sends it back to the requesting application.
    *   **Why**: To successfully complete the business process and provide the data needed for the external system to make its decision.
    *   **When**: This is the final step of a successful workflow.
    *   **Evidence**: The `postOut` reply activity in `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/Process.bwp` sends the final response.

## Evidence Summary

-   **Scope Analyzed**: The analysis covered all TIBCO BusinessWorks processes (`.bwp`), service descriptors (`.json`), schemas (`.xsd`), and configuration files (`.substvar`, `.jdbcResource`) within the `CreditCheckService` project.
-   **Key Data Points**:
    -   1 primary business workflow was identified ("Customer Credit Score Inquiry").
    -   4 distinct business rules governing data integrity and error handling were documented.
    -   The workflow involves 1 database read (`SELECT`) and 1 database write (`UPDATE`).
-   **References**: Findings are based on the process flows in `Process.bwp` and `LookupDatabase.bwp`, the SQL statements within those flows, and the API/data contracts in the `Service Descriptors` and `Schemas` folders.

## Assumptions Made

-   It is assumed that the `bookstore` database and its `public.creditscore` table are the designated single source of truth for customer credit information.
-   It is assumed that the `numofpulls` field is intended to serve as a compliant audit trail for credit inquiries.
-   The business logic is entirely contained within the TIBCO processes; no additional logic is assumed to exist in the database (e.g., in triggers or stored procedures not visible here).

## Open Questions

-   What is the defined business process for handling the "Not Found" (404) error? Does this error trigger a manual data quality review, or is the onus on the calling application to handle it?
-   What is the business rationale for reporting a data completeness failure as a "Not Found" error, rather than a more specific error code that could inform the calling system of a data quality issue?
-   What are the compliance requirements (e.g., FCRA) that govern the storage and access of the data in the `creditscore` table?

## Confidence Level

**Overall Confidence**: High

**Rationale**: The provided files represent a self-contained TIBCO BusinessWorks project. The business logic is explicitly defined in the `.bwp` process files, and the data interactions are clearly specified through JDBC activities and SQL statements. The API contract is also clearly defined in the Swagger JSON files. This provides a solid, evidence-based foundation for the analysis.

**Evidence**:
-   **File references**: `CreditCheckService/Processes/creditcheckservice/LookupDatabase.bwp` contains the core logic, including SQL queries and conditional flows.
-   **Configuration files**: `CreditCheckService/Resources/creditcheckservice/JDBCConnectionResource.jdbcResource` confirms the use of a PostgreSQL database.
-   **Code examples**: The SQL statements `select * from public.creditscore where ssn like ?` and `UPDATE creditscore SET numofpulls = ? WHERE ssn like ?` directly prove the data retrieval and update logic.

## Action Items

**Immediate** (Next 1-2 weeks):
-   [ ] **Business Stakeholder Review**: Schedule a meeting with Risk Management and Compliance to validate the documented rules and workflow.
-   [ ] **Clarify Open Questions**: Engage with the Product Manager to get answers to the "Open Questions" listed above, particularly regarding the handling of "Not Found" errors.

**Short-term** (Next 1-3 months):
-   [ ] **Document Data Remediation Process**: Based on the clarification of error handling, formally document the business process for correcting incomplete credit profiles in the database.

**Long-term** (Next 6-12 months):
-   [ ] **Evaluate Error Handling Policy**: Assess whether the "Obfuscate Internal Failures" policy is optimal, or if more descriptive errors should be provided to calling systems to improve data quality feedback loops.

## Risk Assessment

-   **High Risk**: A failure in the "Credit Inquiry Tracking" rule could lead to compliance violations. If the `UPDATE` query fails silently, the audit trail would become inaccurate.
-   **Medium Risk**: The "Obfuscate Internal Failures" rule, while simplifying integration, creates a risk that data quality issues (incomplete profiles) are not addressed promptly, as they are not explicitly reported to upstream systems.
-   **Low Risk**: The dependency on a single database represents a single point of failure, but this is a standard architectural risk managed by infrastructure availability.
