## Executive Summary

The analysis of the provided codebase reveals that the application is built using TIBCO BusinessWorks and is exclusively composed of RESTful services. No evidence of SOAP services, WSDL-defined endpoints (other than TIBCO's internal representations), or SOAP-specific bindings was found. Consequently, the requested "SOAP to SOAP Refactoring QE Testing Strategy" to migrate from mTLS/no-auth to API Keys is **Not Applicable** as there are no SOAP services to refactor.

## Analysis

### Finding: The Application Utilizes a REST-Based Architecture

A thorough review of the project's configuration, process definitions, and dependencies confirms that all external communication and service exposure is handled via REST/HTTP. The core task of generating a QE strategy for SOAP refactoring cannot be completed because the foundational technology (SOAP) is absent from the codebase.

**Evidence**:
*   **Module Bindings**: The primary service binding in `CreditApp.module/META-INF/module.bwm` is explicitly defined as a `rest:RestServiceBinding`, not a SOAP binding.
    ```xml
    <scaext:binding xsi:type="rest:RestServiceBinding" xmi:id="_KytFoKpNEeiI6tdO_e3S_Q" name="RestService" path="/creditdetails" ...>
    ```
*   **Service Descriptors**: All service definitions are provided in Swagger/OpenAPI JSON format (e.g., `CreditApp.module/Service Descriptors/creditapp.module.MainProcess-CreditDetails.json`), which is characteristic of REST APIs. No WSDL files defining SOAP services were found.
*   **Dependencies and Capabilities**: The module manifest `CreditApp.module/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` explicitly requires REST-related capabilities and does not list any for SOAP.
    ```
    Require-Capability: ... com.tibco.bw.binding.model; filter:="(name=bw.rest)", com.tibco.bw.binding.model; filter:="(name=bw.rest.reference.binding)"
    ```
*   **Process Implementation**: The TIBCO processes, such as `CreditApp.module/Processes/creditapp/module/ExperianScore.bwp`, use generic `bw.http.sendHTTPRequest` activities or REST-specific invoke activities, not SOAP Request-Reply activities.

**Impact**:
*   The premise of the requested report—refactoring existing SOAP services—is invalid for this codebase.
*   A testing strategy for SOAP-to-SOAP security migration cannot be generated.
*   The project's actual modernization needs would relate to REST API security, not SOAP.

## Evidence Summary

*   **Scope Analyzed**: All 41 files in the provided cache, including TIBCO project configurations (`.project`, `.config`), module definitions (`.bwm`), process files (`.bwp`), manifests (`.MF`), and service descriptors (`.json`, `.xsd`).
*   **Key Data Points**:
    *   0 SOAP bindings found.
    *   3 REST service descriptors (`.json`) found.
    *   2 REST-specific capabilities declared in the module manifest.
    *   All process files (`.bwp`) show interactions with REST/HTTP services.
*   **Conclusion**: The evidence consistently and conclusively points to a REST-based architecture.

## Assumptions Made

*   It was assumed that the analysis was intended to find SOAP services within the provided file set to form the basis of the refactoring and testing strategy.
*   It was assumed that the file cache represents the complete and correct scope for the analysis request.

## Open Questions

*   Was this the correct codebase intended for the SOAP-to-SOAP refactoring analysis?
*   Is it possible that the SOAP services exist in a different, unprovided repository that this application consumes? (Note: Even if true, without the service definitions, a refactoring plan cannot be created).

## Confidence Level

**Overall Confidence**: High

**Rationale**: The evidence against the presence of SOAP services is definitive and consistent across all relevant configuration files, manifests, and process definitions. The project is explicitly configured to build and run REST services. There is no ambiguity in the provided files.

## Action Items

**Immediate**:
*   **[ ] Verify Project Scope**: Confirm with stakeholders that `CreditApp` was the intended target for a SOAP refactoring analysis. It is highly likely there has been a misunderstanding of the application's architecture.
*   **[ ] Re-evaluate Tasking**: If the goal is to improve the security of `CreditApp`, the task should be redefined to focus on securing the existing REST APIs, for example, by implementing an API Key or OAuth 2.0 strategy for them.

## Risk Assessment

*   **High Risk**: Proceeding with a SOAP refactoring project based on the initial request would result in wasted effort, as the target technology does not exist in this application. The primary risk is a fundamental misalignment between the requested work and the technical reality of the codebase.
