## Executive Summary
The analysis of the codebase reveals that the application, `CreditApp`, is built on TIBCO BusinessWorks and utilizes a REST-based architecture for its service integrations. No SOAP services, clients, or WSDL-defined SOAP bindings were identified. Consequently, the requested SOAP-to-SOAP refactoring strategy to migrate from mTLS/no-authentication to API Keys is not applicable to this project, as the foundational technology (SOAP) is not in use.

## Analysis
### No SOAP Services Detected
**Evidence**:
- **Service Bindings**: The primary service definition file, `CreditApp.module\META-INF\module.bwm`, explicitly defines service bindings using `rest:RestServiceBinding` and `rest:RestReferenceBinding`. These are TIBCO's standard configurations for creating and consuming RESTful services.
- **Service Descriptors**: The `CreditApp.module\Service Descriptors\` directory contains Swagger 2.0 (OpenAPI) JSON files, such as `creditapp.module.MainProcess-CreditDetails.json`. These files define the contracts for the REST APIs, not SOAP services.
- **Process Implementation**: The core business processes, `EquifaxScore.bwp` and `ExperianScore.bwp`, use TIBCO's REST reference binding and generic `HTTP Send Request` activities to communicate with other services, not SOAP-based clients.

**Impact**: The core premise of the requested report—refactoring existing SOAP-to-SOAP integrations—is invalid. The application's architecture is already aligned with modern RESTful patterns, not legacy SOAP.

**Recommendation**: No action is required regarding a SOAP-to-SOAP refactoring. Any future security enhancements should focus on securing the existing REST endpoints, for example, by implementing an API Gateway like Apigee to manage API Keys, OAuth, or other modern authentication mechanisms.

### Summary of Required Changes
Not Applicable. The codebase does not contain SOAP services that would be candidates for the described refactoring.

### Files Requiring Changes
Not Applicable. No files with SOAP implementations were found.

### Implementation Tasks (Code/Configuration Only)
Not Applicable. The implementation tasks are predicated on the existence of SOAP services.

### Risk Assessment
Not Applicable. The risks associated with a SOAP refactoring project do not apply.

### Codebase Considerations
Not Applicable. The codebase does not use SOAP-specific patterns that would need to be addressed.

## Evidence Summary
- **Scope Analyzed**: The analysis covered all TIBCO BusinessWorks project files, including process definitions (`.bwp`), module configurations (`.bwm`), service descriptors (`.json`), and schema definitions (`.xsd`).
- **Key Data Points**:
  - **0 SOAP services** were identified.
  - **3 REST service descriptors** were found (`creditapp.module.MainProcess-CreditDetails.json`, `creditapp.module.Process-GetCreditDetail.json`, `getcreditstorebackend_0_1_mock_app.json`).
  - **2 HTTP client resources** were found, configured for REST communication (`HttpClientResource1.httpClientResource`, `HttpClientResource2.httpClientResource`).
- **References**: The conclusion is primarily based on the binding types defined in `CreditApp.module\META-INF\module.bwm` and the presence of Swagger/OpenAPI JSON files instead of WSDLs for service contracts.

## Assumptions Made
- It is assumed that the TIBCO binding definitions (`rest:RestServiceBinding`) are the definitive source of truth for the communication protocol, which is standard practice for TIBCO BW6 projects.
- The presence of `.wsdl` references within `.bwm` files is interpreted as TIBCO's internal mechanism for defining an interface contract, not as an indicator of a SOAP-based wire protocol, especially when the binding is explicitly REST.

## Open Questions
- None. The evidence conclusively shows the absence of SOAP integrations.

## Confidence Level
**Overall Confidence**: High

**Rationale**: The evidence is consistent and definitive across all relevant configuration and definition files. The service bindings, service descriptors, and process implementations all point exclusively to a REST/HTTP architecture. There is no conflicting evidence to suggest the presence of SOAP services.
