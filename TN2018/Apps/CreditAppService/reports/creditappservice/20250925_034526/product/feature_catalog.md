## Executive Summary

This application functions as a backend credit score aggregation service. Its primary purpose is to receive an individual's personal information (Name, DOB, SSN), retrieve their credit scores from multiple credit bureaus (specifically Equifax and Experian), and return a consolidated credit profile. This enables business users, such as loan officers or underwriters, to make faster and more informed credit-based decisions.

## Analysis

The codebase implements a set of features designed to automate the credit checking process. These features are centered around data retrieval and aggregation from external partners.

### Feature Catalog

| Feature Name | Business Value | Who Benefits | What It Does | Business Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Aggregated Credit Report Generation** | Provides a holistic view of an applicant's creditworthiness by combining data from multiple sources, leading to more accurate risk assessment. | Underwriters, Loan Officers, Risk Management | Receives an applicant's details (SSN, Name, DOB), automatically queries both Equifax and Experian for their credit scores, and returns a single, consolidated response. | Reduces manual effort, speeds up loan application processing times, and improves the accuracy of lending decisions by preventing reliance on a single data source. |
| **Equifax Credit Data Retrieval** | Enables direct access to Equifax's credit scoring system, a critical data source for financial risk assessment. | Underwriters, Risk Management | Submits an applicant's personal information to an external service representing Equifax and retrieves their FICO score, number of inquiries, and a qualitative rating. | Fulfills a core business requirement for credit evaluation. Failure of this feature would render the aggregated report incomplete and potentially non-compliant. |
| **Experian Credit Data Retrieval** | Provides a secondary, independent credit score from Experian, allowing for data cross-verification and a more robust risk profile. | Underwriters, Risk Management | Submits an applicant's personal information to an external service representing Experian and retrieves their FICO score, number of inquiries, and a qualitative rating. | Increases confidence in credit decisions by providing a corroborating data point. Mitigates the risk of a single bureau having outdated or incorrect information. |

## Evidence Summary

-   **Scope Analyzed**: The analysis focused on the TIBCO BusinessWorks processes (`.bwp` files), service descriptors (`.json` files), and schema definitions (`.xsd` files) to understand the application's business function.
-   **Key Data Points**:
    -   **1** primary business service exposed (`/creditdetails`).
    -   **2** distinct external credit bureau integrations are actively implemented (Equifax and Experian).
    -   **3** key data points are retrieved from each bureau: FICO Score, Number of Inquiries, and Rating.
-   **References**:
    -   The core business logic is defined in `CreditApp.module\Processes\creditapp\module\MainProcess.bwp`, which orchestrates calls to the subprocesses.
    -   The `MainProcess` exposes the `/creditdetails` endpoint as defined in `CreditApp.module\Service Descriptors\creditapp.module.MainProcess-CreditDetails.json`.
    -   The integration with Equifax is implemented in `CreditApp.module\Processes\creditapp\module\EquifaxScore.bwp`.
    -   The integration with Experian is implemented in `CreditApp.module\Processes\creditapp\module\ExperianScore.bwp`.
    -   The input data required (SSN, DOB, Name) is defined in schemas like `CreditApp.module\Schemas\ExperianRequestSchema.xsd`.

## Assumptions Made

-   It is assumed that the process files named `EquifaxScore.bwp` and `ExperianScore.bwp` are indeed integrating with the Equifax and Experian credit bureaus, respectively. The hostnames are parameterized (`ExperianAppHostname`, `BWAppHostname`), but the process names and data schemas strongly support this assumption.
-   The primary user of this application is assumed to be an internal system or employee (e.g., a loan officer using a front-end application that calls this service), not an end-consumer, as the interface is a backend API.
-   The business domain is assumed to be Financial Services, likely in lending, banking, or another industry where credit checks are a core operational requirement.

## Open Questions

-   The response schema `CreditScoreSuccessSchema` defined in `getcreditstorebackend_0_1_mock_app.xsd` includes a `TransUnionResponse` section. However, the `MainProcess.bwp` only contains logic to call Equifax and Experian. Is integration with TransUnion a future requirement, or is this a remnant of a deprecated feature?
-   What are the specific business rules for handling discrepancies between the scores returned by Equifax and Experian? The current process simply aggregates them without any apparent reconciliation logic.
-   What are the service level agreements (SLAs) for response times from the external credit bureaus? The HTTP client resources have a default timeout of 1000ms, which may be too short for these types of inquiries.

## Confidence Level

**Overall Confidence**: High

**Rationale**: The business purpose of the application is exceptionally clear from the TIBCO process names, the data schemas, and the overall workflow. The flow of receiving applicant PII and returning credit scores is unambiguous. The presence of schemas for `FICOScore`, `NoOfInquiries`, and `Rating` confirms the specific business data being handled.

**Evidence**:
-   **File**: `CreditApp.module\Processes\creditapp\module\MainProcess.bwp` clearly shows a "pick" activity that receives a request and then calls two subprocesses, `EquifaxScore` and `ExperianScore`.
-   **File**: `CreditApp.module\Service Descriptors\creditapp.module.MainProcess-CreditDetails.json` defines the `POST /creditdetails` endpoint, which accepts `DOB`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `SSN`.
-   **File**: `CreditApp.module\Schemas\getcreditstorebackend_0_1_mock_app.xsd` defines the `CreditScoreSuccessSchema` which explicitly contains `EquifaxResponse` and `ExperianResponse`, confirming the aggregation feature.

## Action Items

**Immediate**:
-   [ ] **Clarify TransUnion Integration**: Product Management to confirm with stakeholders if the `TransUnionResponse` in the schema represents a planned or deprecated feature to align the product roadmap with the technical implementation.

**Short-term**:
-   [ ] **Document Discrepancy Rules**: Business Analysts to define and document the business rules for handling significant differences in credit scores between Equifax and Experian.

**Long-term**:
-   [ ] **Explore Self-Service Feature**: Investigate the potential for a customer-facing version of this feature, allowing consumers to check their own aggregated credit profile, which could open a new revenue stream or improve customer engagement.

## Risk Assessment

-   **High Risk**: **Dependency on External Partners**. The core functionality of the application is entirely dependent on the availability and performance of the Equifax and Experian APIs. Any outage or API change from these partners will break the application.
-   **Medium Risk**: **Missing Reconciliation Logic**. The lack of defined business rules for handling score discrepancies could lead to inconsistent or poor-quality lending decisions if one bureau's data is inaccurate.
-   **Low Risk**: **Schema Mismatch**. The presence of a `TransUnionResponse` in the schema that is not populated by the process could cause confusion for client applications or require them to build in unnecessary error handling.
